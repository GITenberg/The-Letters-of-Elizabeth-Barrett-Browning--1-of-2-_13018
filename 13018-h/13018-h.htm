<p>The writer of any narrative of Mrs. Browning's life, or the
editor of a collection of her letters, is met at the outset of
his task by the knowledge that both Mrs. Browning herself
and her husband more than, once expressed their strong
dislike of any such publicity in regard to matters of a
personal and private character affecting themselves. The
fact that expressions to this effect are publicly extant is one
which has to be faced or evaded; but if it could not be
fairly faced, and the apparent difficulty removed, the present
volumes would never have seen the light. It would be a
poor qualification for the task of preparing a record of Mrs.
Browning's life, to be willing therein to do violence to her
own expressed wishes and those of her husband. But the
expressions to which reference has been made are limited,
either formally or by implication, to publications made
during their own lifetime. They shrank, as any sensitive
person must shrink, from seeing their private lives, their
personal characteristics, above all, their sorrows and
bereavements, offered to the inspection and criticism of the
general public; and it was to such publications that their
protests referred. They could not but be aware that the
details of their lives would be of interest to the public which
read and admired their works, and there is evidence that
they recognised that the public has some claims with regard
to writers who have appealed to, and partly lived by, its
favour. They only claimed that during their own lifetime
their feelings should be consulted first; when they should
have passed away, the rights of the public would begin.</p>

<p>It is in this spirit that the following collection of Mrs.
Browning's letters has now been prepared, in the conviction
that the lovers of English literature will be glad to make a
closer and more intimate acquaintance with one&mdash;or, it may
truthfully be said, with two&mdash;of the most interesting literary
characters of the Victorian age. It is a selection from a
large mass of letters, written at all periods in Mrs. Browning's
life, which Mr. Browning, after his wife's death, reclaimed
from the friends to whom they had been written, or
from their representatives. No doubt, Mr. Browning's primary
object was to prevent publications which would have been
excessively distressing to his feelings; but the letters, when
once thus collected, were not destroyed (as was the case
with many of his own letters), but carefully preserved, and
so passed into the possession of his son, Mr. R. Barrett
Browning, with whose consent they are now published. In
this collection are comprised the letters to Miss Browning
(the poet's sister, whose consent has also been freely given
to the publication), Mr. H.S. Boyd, Mrs. Martin, Miss
Mitford, Mrs. Jameson, Mr. John Kenyon, Mr. Chorley,
Miss Blagden, Miss Haworth, and Miss Thomson (Madame
Emil Braun).<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> To these have been added a number of
letters which have been kindly lent by their possessors for
the purpose of the present volumes.</p>
<br />

<p>The duties of the editor have been mainly those of
selection and arrangement. With regard to the former task
one word is necessary. It may be thought that the almost
entire absence of bitterness (except on certain political
topics), of controversy, of personal ill feeling of any kind,
is due to editorial excisions. This is not the case. The
number of passages that have been removed for fear of
hurting the feelings of persons still living is almost
infinitesimal; and in these the cause of offence is always
something inherent in the facts recorded, not in the spirit
in which they are mentioned. No person had less animosity
than Mrs. Browning; it seems as though she could hardly
bring herself to speak harshly of anyone. The omissions
that have been made are almost wholly of passages
containing little or nothing of interest, or repetitions of what
has been said elsewhere; and they have been made with
the object of diminishing the bulk and concentrating
the interest of the collection, never with the purpose of
modifying the representation of the writer's character.</p>

<p>The task of arranging the letters has been more arduous
owing to Mrs. Browning's unfortunate habit of prefixing no
date's, or incomplete ones, to her letters. Many of them are
dated merely by the day of the week or month, and can
only be assigned to their proper place in the series on
internal evidence. In some cases, however, the envelopes
have been preserved, and the date is then often provided by
the postmarks. These supply fixed points by which the
others can be tested; and ultimately all have fallen into
line in chronological order, and with at least approximate
dates to each letter.</p>

<p>The correspondence, thus arranged in chronological
order, forms an almost continuous record of Mrs. Browning's
life, from the early days in Herefordshire to her death in
Italy in 1861; but in order to complete the record, it has
been thought well to add connecting links of narrative,
which should serve to bind the whole together into the
unity of a biography. It is a chronicle, rather than a
biography in the artistic sense of the term; a chronicle of
the events of a life in which there were but few external
events of importance, and in which the subject of the
picture is, for the most part, left to paint her own portrait,
and that, moreover, unconsciously. Still, this is a method
which may be held to have its advantages, in that it can
hardly be affected by the feelings or prejudices of the
biographer; and if it does not present a finished portrait to
the reader, it provides him with the materials from which
he can form a portrait for himself. The external events are
placed upon record, either in the letters or in the connecting
links of narrative; the character and opinions of Mrs.
Browning reveal themselves in her correspondence; and
her genius is enshrined in her poetry. And these three
elements make up all that may be known of her personality,
all with which a biographer has to deal.</p>

<p>It is essentially her character, not her genius, that is presented
to the reader of these letters. There are some letter-writers
whose genius is so closely allied with their daily life
that it shines through into their familiar correspondence
with their friends, and their letters become literature.
Such, in their very different ways, with very different types
of genius and very different habits of daily life, are Gray,
Cowper, Lamb, perhaps Fitzgerald. But letter-writers such
as these are few. More often the correspondence of men
and women of letters is valuable for the light it throws upon
the character and opinions of those whose character and
opinions we are led to regard with admiration or respect, or
at least interest, on account of their other writings. In
these cases it may be held that the publication is justifiable
or not, according as the character which it reveals is affected
favourably or the reverse. Not all truth, even about famous
men, is useful for publication, but only such as enables us
to appreciate better the works which have made them
famous. Their highest selves are expressed in their literary
work; and it is a poor service to truth to insist on bringing
to light the fact that they also had lower selves&mdash;common,
dull, it may be vicious. What illustrates their genius and
enhances our respect for their character, may rightly be
made known; but what shakes our belief and mars our
enjoyment in them, is simply better left in obscurity.</p>

<p>With regard to Mrs. Browning, however, there is no
room for doubt upon these points. These letters, familiarly
written to her private friends, without the smallest idea of
publication, treating of the thoughts that came uppermost
in the ordinary language of conversation, can lay no claim
to make a new revelation of her genius. On the other
hand, perhaps because the circumstances of Mrs. Browning's
life cut her off to an unusual extent from personal intercourse
with her friends, and threw her back upon letter-writing
as her principal means of communication with them,
they contain an unusually full revelation of her character.
And this is not wholly unconnected with her literary genius,
since her personal convictions, her moral character, entered
more fully than is often the case into the composition of her
poetry. Her best poetry is that which is most full of her
personal emotions. The 'Sonnets from the Portuguese,'
the 'Cry of the Children,' 'Cowper's Grave,' the 'Dead Pan,'
'Aurora Leigh,' and all the Italian poems, owe their value
to the pure and earnest character, the strong love of truth
and right, the enthusiasm on behalf of what is oppressed
and the indignation against all kinds of oppression and
wrong, which were prominent elements in a personality of
exceptional worth and beauty.</p>

<p>An editor can generally serve his readers best by remaining
in the background; but he is allowed one moment for
the expression of his personal feelings, when he thanks those
who have assisted him in his work. In the present case
there are many to whom it is a pleasure to offer such thanks.
In the first place, I have to thank Mr. R. Barrett Browning
and Miss Browning most cordially for having accepted the
proposal of the publishers (Messrs. Smith, Elder &amp; Co., to
whom likewise my gratitude is due) to put so pleasant and
congenial a task into my hands. Mr. Browning has also
contributed a number of suggestions and corrections while
the sheets have been passing through the press. I have also
to thank those who have been kind enough to offer letters
in their possession for inclusion in these volumes: Lady
Alwyne Compton for the letters to Mr. Westwood; Mrs.
Arthur Severn for the letters to Mr. Ruskin; Mr. G.L. Craik
for the letters to Miss Mulock; Mrs. Commeline for the
letters to Miss Commeline; Mr. T.J. Wise for the letters to
Mr. Cornelius Mathews; Mr. C. Aldrich for the letter to Mrs.
Kinney; Col. T.W. Higginson for a letter to Miss Channing;
and the Rev. G. Bainton for a letter to Mr. Kenyon. It
has not been possible to print all the letters which have
been thus offered; but this does not diminish the kindness
of the lenders, nor the gratitude of the editor.</p>

<p>Finally, I should wish to offer my sincere thanks to Lady
Edmond Fitzmaurice for much assistance and advice in the
selection and revision of the letters; a labour which her
friendship with Mr. Browning towards the close of his life
has prompted her to bestow most freely and fully upon this
memorial of his wife.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, still better known to the
world as Elizabeth Barrett Browning, was born on March 6,
1806, the eldest child of Edward and Mary Moulton
Barrett. I Both the date and place of her birth have been
matters of uncertainty and dispute, and even so trustworthy
an authority as the 'Dictionary of National Biography' is
inaccurate with respect to them. All doubt has, however,
been set at rest by the discovery of the entry of her birth
in the parish register of Kelloe Church, in the county of
Durham.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> She was born at Coxhoe Hall, the residence of
Mr. Barrett's only brother, Samuel, about five miles south
of the city of Durham. Her father, whose name was
originally Edward Barrett Moulton, had assumed the
additional surname of Barrett on the death of his maternal
grandfather, to whose estates in Jamaica he was the heir.
Of Mr. Barrett it is recorded by Mr. Browning, in the notes
prefixed by him to the collected edition of his wife's poems,
that 'on the early death of his father he was brought from
Jamaica to England when a very young child, as a ward of the
late Chief Baron Lord Abinger, then Mr. Scarlett, whom he
frequently accompanied in his post-chaise when on circuit.
He was sent to Harrow, but received there so savage a
punishment for a supposed offence (burning the toast)'&mdash;which,
indeed, has been a 'supposed offence' at other
schools than Harrow&mdash;'by the youth whose fag he had
become, that he was withdrawn from the school by his
mother, and the delinquent was expelled. At the age of
sixteen he was sent by Mr. Scarlett to Cambridge, and thence,
for an early marriage, went to Northumberland.' His wife
was Miss Mary Graham-Clarke, daughter of J. Graham-Clarke,
of Fenham Hall, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, but of her
nothing seems to be known, and her comparatively early
death causes her to be little heard of in the record of her
daughter's life.</p>

<p>Nothing is to be gained by trying to trace back the
genealogy of the Barrett family, and it need merely be noted
that it had been connected for some generations with the
island of Jamaica, and owned considerable estates there.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
It is a curious coincidence that Robert Browning was likewise
in part of West Indian descent, and so, too, was John
Kenyon, the lifelong friend of both, by whose means the
poet and poetess were first introduced to one another.</p>

<p>The family of Mr. Edward Barrett was a fairly large one,
consisting, besides Elizabeth, of two daughters, Henrietta
and Arabel, and eight sons&mdash;Edward, whose tragic death at
Torquay saddened so much of his sister's life, Charles (the
'Stormie' of the letters), Samuel, George, Henry, Alfred,
Septimus, and Octavius; Mr. Barrett's inventiveness having
apparently given out with the last two members of his
family, reducing him to the primitive method of simple
enumeration, an enumeration in which, it may be observed,
the daughters counted for nothing. Not many of these,
however, can have been born at Coxhoe; for while Elizabeth
was still an infant&mdash;apparently about the beginning of the
year 1809&mdash;Mr. Barrett removed to his newly purchased
estate of Hope End, in Herefordshire, among the Malvern
hills, and only a few miles from Malvern itself. It is to
Hope End that the admirers of Mrs. Browning must
look as the real home of her childhood and youth. Here
she spent her first twenty years of conscious life. Here is
the scene of the childish reminiscences which are to be
found among her earlier poems, of 'Hector in the Garden,'
'The Lost Bower,' and 'The Deserted Garden.' And here
too her earliest verses were written, and the foundations
laid of that omnivorous reading of literature of all sorts and
kinds, which was so strong a characteristic of her tastes
and leanings.</p>

<p>On this subject she may be left to tell her own tale. In
a letter written on October 5, 1843, to Mr. R.H. Horne, she
furnishes him with the following biographical details for his
study of her in 'The New Spirit of the Age.' They supply
us with nearly all that we know of her early life and writings.</p>

<p>'And then as to stories, my story amounts to the knife-grinder's,
with nothing at all for a catastrophe. A bird in a
cage would have as good a story, Most of my events, and
nearly all my intense pleasures, have passed in my <i>thoughts</i>.
I wrote verses&mdash;as I dare say many have done who never
wrote any poems&mdash;very early; at eight years old and earlier.
But, what is less common, the early fancy turned into a will,
and remained with me, and from that day to this, poetry
has been a distinct object with me&mdash;an object to read, think,
and live for. And I could make you laugh, although you
could not make the public laugh, by the narrative of nascent
odes, epics, and didactics crying aloud on obsolete muses
from childish lips. The Greeks were my demi-gods, and
haunted me out of Pope's Homer, until I dreamt more of
Agamemnon than of Moses the black pony. And thus my
great &quot;epic&quot; of eleven or twelve years old, in four books,
and called &quot;The Battle of Marathon,&quot; and of which fifty
copies were printed because papa was bent upon spoiling
me&mdash;is Pope's Homer done over again, or rather undone;
for, although a curious production for a child, it gives
evidence only of an imitative faculty and an ear, and a good
deal of reading in a peculiar direction. The love of Pope's
Homer threw me into Pope on one side and into Greek on
the other, and into Latin as a help to Greek&mdash;and the
influence of all these tendencies is manifest so long afterwards
as in my &quot;Essay on Mind,&quot; a didactic poem written
when I was seventeen or eighteen, and long repented of as
worthy of all repentance. The poem is imitative in its form,
yet is not without traces of an individual thinking and feeling&mdash;the
bird pecks through the shell in it. With this it has
a pertness and pedantry which did not even then belong to
the character of the author, and which I regret now more
than I do the literary defectiveness.</p>

<p>'All this time, and indeed the greater part of my life, we
lived at Hope End, a few miles from Malvern, in a retirement
scarcely broken to me except by books and my own
thoughts, and it is a beautiful country, and was a retirement
happy in many ways, although the very peace of it troubles
the heart as it looks back. There I had my fits of Pope,
and Byron, and Coleridge, and read Greek as hard under
the trees as some of your Oxonians in the Bodleian;
gathered visions from Plato and the dramatists, and eat
and drank Greek and made my head ache with it. Do you
know the Malvern Hills? The hills of Piers Plowman's
Visions? They seem to me my native hills; for, although
I was born in the county of Durham, I was an infant when
I went first into their neighbourhood, and lived there until
I had passed twenty by several years. Beautiful, beautiful
hills they are! And yet, not for the whole world's beauty
would I stand in the sunshine and the shadow of them any
more. It would be a mockery, like the taking back of a
broken flower to its stalk.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p>So, while the young Robert Browning was enthusiastically
declaiming passages of Pope's Homer, and measuring out
heroic couplets with his hand round the dining table in
Camberwell, Elizabeth Barrett was drinking from the same
fount of inspiration among the Malvern Hills, and was
already turning it to account in the production of her first
epic. The fifty copies of the 'Battle of Marathon,' which
Mr. Barrett, proud of his daughter's precocity, insisted on
having printed, bear the date of 1819. Only five of them
are now known to exist, and these are all in private hands;
even the British Museum possesses only the reprint which
the hero-worship of the present generation caused to be produced
in 1891. Seven years later, when she had just reached
the age of twenty, her first volume of verse was offered to
the world in general. It was entitled 'An Essay on Mind,
and other Poems,' and included, besides the didactic poem
after the manner of Pope which formed the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&egrave;sistance</i>,
a number of shorter pieces, several of which, as she informed
Horne,<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> had been written when she was not more than
thirteen.</p>

<p>It was during the years at Hope End that Elizabeth
Barrett was first attacked by serious illness. 'At fifteen,'
she says in her autobiographical letter, already quoted in
part, 'I nearly died;' and this may be connected with a
statement by Mrs. Richmond Ritchie, to the effect that
'one day, when Elizabeth was about fifteen, the young
girl, impatient for her ride, tried to saddle her pony alone,
in a field, and fell with the saddle upon her, in some way
injuring her spine so seriously that she was for years upon
her back.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The latter part of this statement cannot indeed
be quite accurate; for her period of long confinement to a
sick-room was of later date, and began, according to her
own statement, from a different cause. Mr. R. Barrett
Browning states that the injury to the spine was not
discovered for some time, but was afterwards attributed, not
to a fall, but to a strain whilst tightening her pony's girths.
No doubt this injury contributed towards the general weakness
of health to which she was always subject.</p>

<p>Of her earliest letters, belonging to the Hope End
period, very few have been preserved, and most of those
which remain are of little interest. The first to be printed
here belongs to the period of her mother's last illness,
which ended in her death on October 1, 1828. It is
addressed to Mrs. James Martin, a lifelong friend, whose
name will appear frequently in these pages. At the time
when it was written she was living near Tewkesbury, within
visiting distance of the Barretts.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Hope End: Thursday, [about September 1828].<br />

<p>My dear Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I am happy to be able to tell
you that Mr. Garden was here two days ago, and that he
has not thought it necessary to adopt any violent measure
with regard to our beloved invalid. He seems entirely to
rely, for her ultimate restoration, upon a discipline as to
diet, and a course of strengthening medicine. This is most
satisfactory to us; and her spirits have been soothed and
tranquillised by his visit. She has slept quietly for the last
few nights, and reports herself to be <i>brisker</i> and stronger,
and to be comparatively free from pain. This account is,
perhaps, too favorable,<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and will appear so to you when
you see her, as I am afraid you will, not looking much
better, <i>much</i> more cheerful, than when you paid us your last
visit. But when we are very <i>willing</i> to hope, we are apt to
be too <i>ready</i> to hope: though really, without being <i>too</i>
sanguine, we may consider quiet nights and diminished pain
to be satisfactory signs of amendment. I know you will be
glad to hear of them, and I hope you will <i>witness</i> them very
soon, in spite of this repulsive snow. It will do mama
good, and I am sure it will give us all pleasure, to benefit by
some of your charitable pilgrimages over the hill.</p>

<p>With our best regards, and sincerest thanks for your
kind interest</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Mrs. Martin, most truly yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p><i>To Miss Commeline</i><br />
Hope End: Monday, [October 1828].</p>


<p></p>
<p>My dear Miss Commeline,&mdash;Thank you for the sympathy
and interest which you have extended towards us in our heavy
affliction. Even <i>you</i> cannot know <i>all</i> that we have lost;
but God knows, and it has pleased Him to take away the
blessing that He gave. And all <i>must</i> be right since He
doeth all! Indeed we did not foresee this great grief! If we
had we could not have felt it less; but I should not then
have been denied the consolation of being with her at the last.</p>

<p>It is idle to speak now of such thoughts, and circumstances
have unquestionably been rightly and mercifully
ordered. We are all well and composed&mdash;poor papa
supporting us by his own surpassing fortitude. It is an
inexpressible comfort to me to witness his calmness.</p>

<p>I cannot say that we shall not be glad to see you, but
the weather is dreary and the distance long: and if you
were to come, we might not be able to meet you and to
speak to you with calmness. In that case you would
receive a melancholy impression which I should like to
spare you. Perhaps it would be better for you and less
selfish in us, if we were to defer this meeting a little while
longer&mdash;but do what you prefer doing! I can never forget
the regard and esteem entertained for you by one whose
tenderness and watchfulness I have felt every day and hour
since she gave me that life which her loss embitters&mdash;whose
memory is more precious to me than any earthly
blessing left behind; I have written what is ungrateful,
and what I ought not to have written, and what I ought
not to feel, and do not always feel, but I did not just then
remember that I had so much left to love.</p>
<br />
<br />
<i>To Mrs. Boyd</i><br />
Hope End: Saturday morning, [1828-1832].<br />

<p>My dear Mrs. Boyd,&mdash;You were quite wrong in supposing
that papa was likely to complain about 'the number of
letters from Malvern;' and as to my doing so, why did you
suggest that? To fill up a sentence, or to conjure up some
kind of limping excuse for idle people? Among idle people,
perhaps you have written <i>me</i> down. But the reason of my
silence was far more reasonable than yours. I have been
engaged in alternately wishing in earnest and wishing in
vain for the power of saying when I could go to Malvern&mdash;and
in being unwell besides. For the last week I have not
been at all well, and indeed was obliged yesterday to go to
bed after breakfast instead of after tea, where I contrived to
abstract myself out of a good deal of pain into Lord
Byron's Life by Moore. To-day this abstraction is not
necessary; I am much better; and, indeed, little remains of
the indisposition but the <i>vulgar fractions</i> of a cough and
cold. I dare say (and Occyta<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> agrees with me) cold was at
the bottom of it all, for I was so very wise as to lie down
upon the grass last Monday, when the sun was shining
deceitfully, though the snow was staring at me from the
hedges, with an expression anything but dog-daysical!</p>

<p>Henrietta's face-ache is quite well, and I don't mean to
give any more bulletins to-day. I hope your 'tolerably
well' is turned into 'quite well' too by this time.</p>

<p>In reply to your query, I will mention that <i>the existence</i>
actually extended until Thursday without the visit here&mdash;a
phenomenon in physics and metaphysics. I was desired by
a note a short time previously, 'to embrace all my circle
with the utmost tenderness,' <i>as proxy</i>. Considering the
extent of the said circle, this was a very comprehensive
request, and a very unreasonable one to offer to anyone less
than the hundred-armed Indian god Baly. I am glad that
your alternative of a house is so near to the right side of
the turnpike&mdash;in which case, a <i>miss</i> is certainly not as <i>bad</i>
as a <i>mile</i>. May Place is to be vacated in May, though its
present inhabitants do not leave Malvern. I mention this
to you, but pray don't <i>re-mention</i> it to anybody. The rent
is 15&pound;. Mr. Boyd<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> will not be angry with me for not
going to see him sooner than I can. At least, I am sure he
ought not. Though you are all kind enough to wish me to
go, I always think and know (which is consolatory to everything
but my vanity) that no one can wish it half as much
as I myself do.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Mrs. Boyd, affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>The fear 1832 brought a great change in the fortunes of
the Barrett family, and may be said to mark the end of the
purely formative period in Elizabeth Barrett's life. Hitherto
she had been living in the home and among the surroundings
of her childhood, absorbing literature rather than producing
it; or if producing it, still mainly for her own
amusement and instruction, rather than with any view of
appealing to the general public. But in 1832 this home
was broken up by the sale, of Hope End,<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and with the
removal thence we seem to find her embarking definitely on
literature as the avowed pursuit and occupation of her life.
Sidmouth in Devonshire was the place to which the Barrett
family now removed, and the letters begin henceforth to be
longer and more frequent, and to tell a more connected tale.</p>

<br /><br />
<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
[Sidmouth: September 1832.]<br />

<p>How can I thank you enough, dearest Mrs. Martin, for
your letter? How kind of you to write so soon and so
very kindly! The postmark and handwriting were in themselves
pleasant sights to me, and the kindness yet more
welcome. Believe that I am grateful to you for <i>all</i> your
kindness&mdash;for your kindness now, and your kindness in the
days which are past. Some of those past days were very
happy, and some of them very sorrowful&mdash;more sorrowful
than even our last days at dear, dear Hope End. <i>Then</i>, I
well recollect, though I could not then thank you as I ought,
how you <i>felt for</i> us and <i>with</i> us. Do not think I can ever
forget <i>that time</i>, or <i>you</i>. I had written a note to you, which
the bearer of Bummy's and Arabel's to Colwall<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> omitted
to take. Afterwards I thought it best to spare you any
more farewells, which are upon human lips, of all words,
the most natural, and of all the most painful.</p>

<p>They told us of our having past your carriage in
Ledbury. Dear Mrs. Martin, I cannot dwell upon the
pain of that first hour of our journey; but you will know
what it must have been. The dread of it, for some hours
before, was almost worse; but it is all over now, blessed be
God. Before the first day's journey was at end, we felt
inexpressibly relieved&mdash;relieved from the restlessness and
anxiety which have so long oppressed us&mdash;and now we
are calmer and happier than we have been for very long.
If we could only have papa and Bro and Sette<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> with us!
About half an hour before we set off, papa found out that
he <i>could not</i> part with Sette, who sleeps with him, and is
always an amusing companion to him. Papa was, however,
unwilling to separate him perforce from his little playfellows,
and asked him whether he wished very much to go. Sette's
heart was quite full, but he answered immediately, 'Oh, no,
papa, I would <i>much</i> rather stay with <i>you</i>.' He is a dear
affectionate little thing. He and Bro being with poor
Papa, we are far more comfortable about him than we
should otherwise be&mdash;and perhaps our going was his
sharpest pang. I hope it was, as it is over. Do not
think, dear Mrs. Martin, that you or Mr. Martin can ever
'intrude'&mdash;you know you use that word in your letter. I
have often been afraid, on account of papa not having been
for so long a time at Colwall, lest you should fancy that he
did not value your society and your kindness. Do not
fancy it. Painful circumstances produce&mdash;as we have often
had occasion to observe&mdash;different effects upon different
minds; and some feeling, with which I certainly have no
sympathy has made papa shrink from society of any kind
lately. He would not even attend the religious societies
in Ledbury, which he was so much pledged to support, and
so interested in supporting. If you knew how much he
has talked of you, and asked every particular about you, you
could not fancy that his regard for you was estranged. He
has an extraordinary degree of strength of mind on most
points&mdash;and strong feeling, when it is not allowed to run in
the natural channel, will sometimes force its way where it is
not expected. You will think it strange; but never up to
this moment has he even alluded to the subject, before
<i>us</i>&mdash;never, at the moment of parting with us. And yet,
though he had not power to say <i>one word</i>, he could play
at cricket with the boys on the very last evening.</p>

<p>We slept at the York House in Bath. Bath is a beautiful
town <i>as a town</i>, and the country harmonises well with
it, without being a beautiful country. As <i>mere country</i>,
nobody would stand still to look at it; though as town
country, many bodies would. Somersetshire in general
seems to be hideous, and I could fancy from the walls which
intersect it in every direction, that they had been turned to
stone by looking at the <i>Gorgonic</i> scenery. The part of
Devonshire through which our journey lay is nothing <i>very</i>
pretty, though it must be allowed to be beautiful after
Somersetshire. We arrived here almost in the dark, and
were besieged by the crowd of disinterested tradespeople,
who <i>would</i> attend us through the town to our house, to
help to unload the carriages. This was not a particularly
agreeable reception in spite of its cordiality; and
the circumstance of there being not a human being in our
house, and not even a rushlight burning, did not reassure
us. People were tired of expecting us every day for three
weeks. Nearly the whole way from Honiton to this place
is a descent. Poor dear Bummy said she thought we were
going into the <i>bowels of the earth</i>, but suspect she
thought we were going much deeper. Between you and
me, she does not seem <i>delighted</i> with Sidmouth; but her
spirits are a great deal better, and in time she will, I dare
say, be better pleased. <i>We</i> like very much what we have
seen of it. The town is small and not superfluously clean,
but, of course, the respectable houses are not a part of the
town. Ours is one which the Grand Duchess Helena had,
not at all <i>grand</i>, but extremely comfortable and cheerful,
with a splendid sea view in front, and pleasant green, hills and
trees behind. The drawing-room's four windows all
look to the sea, and I am never tired of looking out of
them. I was doing so, with a most hypocritical book
before me, when your letter arrived, and I <i>felt</i> all that you
said in it. I always thought that the sea was the sublimest
object in nature. Mont Blanc&mdash;Niagara must be nothing
to it. <i>There</i>, the Almighty's form glasses itself in
tempests&mdash;and not only in tempests, but in calm&mdash;in space,
in eternal motion, in eternal regularity. How can we look at
it, and consider our puny sorrows, and not say, 'We are
dumb&mdash;because <i>Thou</i> didst it'? Indeed, dear Mrs. Martin,
we must feel every hour, and we shall feel every year, that what
He did is <i>well done</i>&mdash;and not only well, but mercifully.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, with whom papa is slightly acquainted,
have called upon us, and shown us many kind attentions.
They are West India people, not very polished, but certainly
<i>very</i> good-natured. We hear that the place is
extremely full and gay; but this is, of course, only an <i>on dit</i>
to us at present. I have been riding a donkey two or three
times, and enjoy very much going to the edge of the sea.
The air has made me sleep more soundly than I have done
for some time, and I dare say it will do me a great deal of
good in every way.</p>

<p>You may suppose what a southern climate this is, when
I tell you that myrtles and verbena, three or four feet high,
and hydrangeas are in flower in the gardens&mdash;even in ours,
which is about a hundred and fifty yards from the sea. I
have written to the end of my paper. Give our kindest
regards to Mr. Martin, and ever believe me,</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
[Sidmouth:] Wednesday, September 27, 1832 [postmark].<br />

<p>How very kind of you, dearest Mrs. Martin, to write to
me so much at length and at such a time. Indeed, it was
exactly the time when, if we were where we have been, we
should have wished you to walk over the hill and talk to us;
and although, after all that the most zealous friends of
letter writing can say for it, it is <i>not</i> such a happy thing as
talking with those you care for, yet it is the next happiest
thing. I am sure I thought so when I read your letter ...</p>

<p>And now I must tell you about ourselves. Papa and Bro
and Sette have made us so much happier by coming, and
we have the comfort of seeing dear papa in good spirits,
and not only satisfied but pleased with this place. It is
scarcely possible, at least it seems so to me, to do otherwise
than admire the beauty of the country. It is the very land
of green lanes and pretty thatched cottages. I don't mean the
kind of cottages which are generally thatched, with pigstyes
and cabbages and dirty children, but thatched cottages with
verandas and shrubberies, and sounds from the harp or piano
coming through the windows. When you stand upon any of
the hills which stand round Sidmouth, the whole valley seems
to be thickly wooded down to the very verge of the sea, and
these pretty villas to be springing from the ground almost
as thickly and quite as naturally as the trees themselves.
There are certainly many more houses out of the town than
in it, and they all stand apart, yet near, hiding in their own
shrubberies, or behind the green rows of elms which wall in
the secluded lanes on either side. Such a number of green
lanes I never saw; some of them quite black with foliage,
where it is twilight in the middle of the day, and others
letting in beautiful glimpses of the spreading heathy hills or
of the sunny sea. I am sure you would like the transition
from the cliffs, from the bird's eye view to, I was going to
say, the mole's eye view, but I believe moles don't see
quite clearly enough to suit my purpose. There are a great
number of people here. Sam was at an evening party a
week ago where there were a hundred and twenty people;
but they don't walk about the parade and show themselves
as one might expect. <i>We</i> know only the Herrings and
Mrs. and the Miss Polands and Sir John Kean. Mrs. and
Miss Weekes, and Mr. and Mrs. James have called upon us,
but we were out when they came. I suppose it will be necessary
to return their visits and to know them; and when we do,
you shall hear about them, and about everybody whom we
know. I am certainly much better in health, stronger than
I was, and less troubled with the cough. Every day I
attend [<i>word torn out</i>] their walks on my donkey, if
we do not go in a boat, which is still pleasanter. I believe
Henrietta walks out about <i>three</i> times a day. She is
looking particularly well, and often talks, and I am sure
still oftener thinks, of you. You know how fond of you she
is. Papa walks out with her&mdash;and <i>us</i>; and we all, down to
Occyta, breakfast and drink tea together. The dining takes
place at five o'clock. To-morrow, if this lovely weather will
stand still and be accommodating, we talk of rowing to
Dawlish, which is about ten miles off. We have had a few
cases of cholera, at least <i>suspicious</i> cases: one a fortnight
before we arrived, and five since, in the course of a month.
All dead except one. I confess a little nervousness; but it is
wearing away. The disease does not seem to make any
progress; and for the last six days there have been no
patients at all.</p>

<p>Do let us hear very soon, my dear Mrs. Martin, how you
are&mdash;how your spirits are, and whether Rome is still in your
distance. Surely no plan could be more delightful for you
than this plan; and if you don't stay <i>very</i> long away, I shall
be sorry to hear of your abandoning it. Do you recollect
your promise of coming to see us? <i>We</i> do.</p>

<p>You must have had quite enough now of my 'little
hand' and of my details. Do not go to Matton or to the
Bartons or to Eastnor without giving my love. How often
my thoughts are at <i>home</i>! I cannot help calling it so still
in my thoughts. I may like other places, but no other
place can ever appear to me to deserve that name.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin's affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p><br />
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Sidmouth: December 14, 1832.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I hope you are very angry
indeed with us for not writing. We are as penitent as
we ought to be&mdash;that is, I am, for I believe I am the idle
person; yet not altogether idle, but procrastinating and
waiting for news rather more worthy of being read in Rome
than any which even now I can send you.... And
now, my dear Mrs. Martin, I mean to thank you, as I
ought to have done long ago, for your kindness in offering
to procure for me the <i>Archbishop of Dublin's</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> valuable
opinion upon my 'Prometheus. I am sure that if you
have not thought me very ungrateful, you must be very
indulgent. My mind was at one time so crowded by
painful thoughts, that they shut out many others which are
interesting to me; and among other things, I forgot once
or twice, when I had an opportunity, to thank <i>you</i>, dear Mrs.
Martin. I believe I should have taken advantage of your
proposal, but papa said to me, 'If he criticises your manuscript
in a manner which does not satisfy you, you won't be
easy without defending yourself, and he might be drawn
into taking more trouble than you have now any idea of
giving him.' I sighed a little at losing such an opportunity
of gaining a great advantage, but there seemed to be some
reason in what papa said I have completed a preface and
notes to my translation; and since doing so, a work of
exactly the same character by a Mr. Medwin has been
published, and commended in Bulwer's magazine.<a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Therefore
it is probable enough that my trouble, excepting as far
as my own amusement went, has been in vain. But papa
means to try Mr. Valpy, I believe. He left us since I
began to write this letter, with a promise of returning before
Christmas Day. We <i>do</i> miss him. Mr. Boyd has made me
quite angry by publishing his translations by rotation in
numbers of the 'Wesleyan Magazine,' instead of making
them up into a separate publication, as I had persuaded
him to do. There is the effect, you see, of going, even for
a time, out of my reach! The readers of the 'Wesleyan
Magazine' are pious people, but not cultivated, nor, for the
most part, capable of estimating either the talents of
Gregory or his translator's. I have begun already to <i>insist</i>
upon another publication in a separate form, and shall gain
my point, I dare say. I have been reading Bulwer's novels
and Mrs. Trollope's libels, and Dr. Parr's works. I am
sure <i>you</i> are not an admirer of Mrs. Trollope's. She has
neither the delicacy nor the candour which constitute true
nobility of mind and her extent of talent forms but a
scanty veil to shadow her other defects. Bulwer has quite
delighted me. He has all the dramatic talent which Scott
has, and all the passion which Scott has not, and he appears
to me to be besides a far profounder discriminator of
character. There are very fine things in his 'Denounced.'
We subscribe to the best library here, but the best is not a
good one. I have, however, a table-load of my own books,
and with them I can always be satisfied. Do you know
that Mr. Curzon has left Ledbury? We were glad to
receive your letter from Dover although it told us that you
were removing so far from us. Do let us hear of your enjoying
Italy. Is there much English society in Rome,
and is it like English society here? I can scarcely fancy
an invitation card, 'Mrs. Huggin-muggin at home,' carried
through the <i>Via Sacra</i>. I am sure my 'little hand' has done
its duty to-day. I shall leave the corners to Henrietta.
Give our kindest regards to Mr. Martin, and ever believe me,
my dear Mrs. Martin,</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>The letter just printed contains the first allusion in
Miss Barrett's letters to any of her own writings. The
translation of the 'Prometheus Bound' of Aeschylus was
the first-fruits of the removal to Sidmouth. It was written, as
she told Horne eleven years afterwards, 'in twelve days, and
should have been thrown into the fire afterwards&mdash;the only
means of giving it a little warmth.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Indeed, so dissatisfied
did she subsequently become with it, that she did what she
could to suppress it, and in the collected edition of 1850
substituted another version, written in 1845, which she
hoped would secure the final oblivion of her earlier attempt.<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
The letter given above shows that the composition of the
earlier version took place at the end of 1832; and in the
following year it was published by Mr. Valpy, along with
some shorter poems, of which Miss Barrett subsequently
wrote that 'a few of the fugitive poems may be worth a
little, perhaps; but they have not so much goodness as to
overcome the badness of the blasphemy of Aeschylus.'
The volume, which was published anonymously, received
two sentences of contemptuous notice from the 'Athenaeum,'
in which the reviewer advised 'those who adventure in the
hazardous lists of poetic translation to touch anyone rather
than Aeschylus, and they may take warning by the author
before us.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<br /><i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Sidmouth: May 27, 1833.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I am half afraid of your being
very angry indeed with me; and perhaps it would be quite
as well to spare this sheet of paper an angry look of yours,
by consigning it over to Henrietta. Yet do believe me,
I have been anxious to write to you a long time, and did
not know where to direct my letter. The history of all my
unkindness to you is this: I delayed answering your kind
welcome letter from Rome, for three weeks, because
Henrietta was at Torquay, and I knew that she would like
to write in it, and because I was unreasonable enough to
expect to hear every day of her coming home. At the end
of the three weeks, and on consulting your dates and plans,
I found out that you would probably have quitted Rome
before any letter of mine arrived there. Since then, I have
been inquiring, and all in vain, about where I could find
you out. All I could hear was, that you were somewhere
between Italy and England; and all I could do was, to
wait patiently, and throw myself at your feet as soon as you
came within sight and hearing. And now do be as generous
as you can, my dear Mrs. Martin, and try to forgive one
who never <i>could</i> be guilty of the fault of forgetting you,
notwithstanding appearances. We heard only yesterday of
your being expected at Colwall. And although we cannot
welcome you there, otherwise than in this way, at the
distance of 140 miles, yet we must welcome you in this
way, and assure both of you how glad we are that the same
island holds all of us once more. It pleased us very much
to hear how you were enjoying yourselves in Rome; and
you must please us now by telling us that you are enjoying
yourselves at Colwall, and that you bear the change with
English philosophy. The fishing at Abbeville was a link
between the past and the present; and would make the
transition between the eternal city and the eternal tithes
a little less striking. My wonder is how you could have
persuaded yourselves to keep your promise and leave Italy
as soon as you did. Tell me how you managed it. And
tell me everything about yourselves&mdash;how you are and how
you feel, and whether you look backwards or forwards with
the most pleasure, and whether the influenza has been
among your welcomers to England. Henrietta and Arabel
and Daisy<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> were confined by it to their beds for several days
and the two former are only now recovering their strength.
Three or four of the other boys had symptoms which were
not strong enough to put them to bed. As for me, I have
been quite well all the spring, and almost all the winter. I
don't know when I have been so long well as I have been
lately; without a cough or anything else disagreeable.
Indeed, if I may place the influenza in a parenthesis, we
have all been perfectly well, in spite of our fishing and
boating and getting wet three times a day. There is good
trout-fishing at the Otter, and the noble river Sid, which, if
I liked to stand in it, <i>might</i> cover my ankles. And lately,
Daisy and Sette and Occyta have studied the art of catching
shrimps, and soak themselves up to their waists like professors.
My love of water concentrates itself in the boat;
and this I enjoy very much, when the sea is as blue and
calm as the sky, which it has often been lately. Of society
we have had little indeed; but Henrietta had more than
much of it at Torquay during three months; and as for me,
you know I don't want any though I am far from meaning
to speak disrespectfully of <i>Mr. Boyds</i>, which has been a
pleasure and comfort to me. His house is not farther than
a five minutes' walk from ours; and I often make it <i>four</i> in
my haste to get there. Ask Eliza Cliffe to lend you the
May number of the 'Wesleyan Magazine;' and if you have
an opportunity of procuring last December's number, <i>do</i>
procure <i>that</i>. There are some translations in each of them,
which I think you will like. The December translation is
my favourite, though I was amanuensis only in the May one.
Henrietta and Arabel have a drawing master, and are
meditating soon beginning to sketch out of doors&mdash;that is,
if before the meditation is at an end we do not leave
Sidmouth. Our plans are quite uncertain; and papa has
not, I believe, made up his mind whether or not to take this
house on after the beginning of next month; when our
engagement with our present landlord closes. If we do
leave Sidmouth, you know as well as I do where we shall
go. Perhaps to Boulogne! perhaps to the Swan River.
The West Indians are irreparably ruined if the Bill passes.
Papa says that in the case of its passing, nobody in his
senses would think of even attempting the culture of sugar,
and that they had better hang weights to the sides of the
island of Jamaica and sink it at once. Don't you think
certain heads might be found heavy enough for the purpose?
No insinuation, I assure you, against the Administration, in
spite of the dagger in their right hands. Mr. Atwood seems
to me a demi-god of ingratitude! So much for the 'fickle
reek of popular breath' to which men have erected their
temple of the winds&mdash;who would trust a feather to it? I am
almost more sorry for poor Lord Grey who is going to ruin
us, than for our poor selves who are going to be ruined.
You will hear that my 'Prometheus and other Poems' came
into light a few weeks ago&mdash;a fortnight ago, I think. I dare
say I shall wish it out of the light before I have done with
it. And I dare say Henrietta is wishing me anywhere,
rather than where I am. Certainly I have past <i>all bounds</i>.
Do write soon, and tell us everything about Mr. Martin and
yourself. And ever believe me, dearest Mrs. Martin,</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Sidmouth: September 7, 1833.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Are you a <i>little</i> angry <i>again</i>?
I do hope not. I should have written long ago if it had not
been for Henrietta; and Henrietta would have written very
lately if it had not been for me: and we must beg of you to
forgive us both for the sake of each other. Thank you for
the kind letter which I have been so tardy in thanking you
for, but which was not, on that account, the less gladly
received. Do believe how much it pleases me <i>always</i> to
see and read dear Mrs. Martin's handwriting. But I must
try to tell you some less ancient truths. We are still in the
ruinous house. Without any poetical fiction, the walls are
too frail for even <i>me</i>, who enjoy the situation in a most
particularly particular manner, to have any desire to pass the
winter within them. One wind we have had the privilege of
hearing already; and down came the tiles while we were at
dinner, and made us all think that down something else was
coming. We have had one chimney pulled down to prevent
it from tumbling down; and have received especial injunctions
from the bricklayers not to lean too much out of the
windows, for fear the walls should follow the destiny of the
chimney. Altogether there is every reasonable probability
that the whole house will in the course of next winter be as
like Persepolis as anything so ugly can be! If another
house which will fit us can be found in Sidmouth, I am
sure papa will take it; but, as he said the other day, 'If I
can't find a house, I must go.' I hope he may find one,
and as near the sea as this ruin. I have enjoyed its moonlight
and its calmness all the summer; and am prepared to
enjoy its tempestuousness of the winter with as true an
enjoyment. What we shall do ultimately, I do not even
dream; and, if I know papa, <i>he</i> does not. My visions of
the future are confined to 'what shall I write or read next,'
and 'when shall we next go out in the boat,' and <i>they</i>, you
know, can do no harm to anybody. Of one thing I have a
comforting certainty&mdash;that wherever we may go or stay, the
decree which moves or fixes us will and must be the 'wisest
virtuousest discreetest best!' ...</p>

<p>So, I will change the subject to myself. You told me
that you were going to read my book, and I want to know
what you think of it. If you were given to compliment and
insincerity, I should be afraid of asking you; because,
among other <i>evident</i> reasons, I might then appear to be
asking for your praise instead of your opinion. As it is&mdash;I
want to know what you think of my book. Is the translation
stiff? If you know me at all (and I venture to hope
that you do) you will be certain that I shall <i>like</i> your
honesty, and love you for being honest, even if you put on
the very blackest of black caps....</p>

<p>Of course you know that the late Bill has ruined the
West Indians. That is settled. The consternation here is
very great. Nevertheless I am glad, and always shall be,
that the negroes are&mdash;virtually&mdash;free!</p>

<p>May God bless you, dear Mrs. Martin!</p>

<p>Ever believe me, your affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Sidmouth: Friday [1834].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I don't know how I shall begin to
persuade you not to be angry with me, but perhaps the best
plan will be to confess as many sins as would cover this
sheet of paper, and then to go on with my merits. Certainly
I am altogether guiltless of your charge of not noticing
your book's arrival because no Calvinism arrived with it.
I told you the bare truth when I told you <i>why</i> I did not
write immediately. The passage relating to Calvinism I
certainly read, and as certainly was sorry for; but as
certainly as both those certainties, such reading and such
regret had nothing whatever to do with the silence which
made you so angry with me.</p>

<p>The other particular thing of which I should have
written is Mr. Parker and my letters. I am more and,
more sorry that you should have sent them to him at all&mdash;not
that their loss is any loss to anybody, but that I scarcely
like the idea&mdash;indeed, I don't like it at all&mdash;of their
remaining, worthless as they are, at Mr. P.'s mercy. As
for my writing about them, I should not be able to make
up my mind to do <i>that</i>. You know I had nothing to do
with their being sent to Mr. Parker, and was indeed
in complete ignorance of it. Besides, I should be half
ashamed to write to him now on any subject. A very long
interregnum took place in our correspondence, which was
his own work; and when he wrote to me the summer before
last, I delayed from week to week, and then from month to
month, answering it. And now I feel ashamed to write at all.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will wonder why I am not ashamed to
write to <i>you</i>. Indeed I have meant to do it very, very
often. Don't be severe upon me. I am always afraid of
writing to you too often, and so the opposite fault is apt to
be run into&mdash;of writing too seldom. IF THAT is a <i>fault</i>.
You see my scepticism is becoming faster and faster
developed.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you soon, if you are not angry. I
have been reading the Bridgewater treatise, and am now
trying to understand Prout upon Chemistry. I shall be
worth something at last, shall I not? Who knows but
what I may die a glorious death under the <i>pons asinorum</i>
after all? Prout (if I succeed in understanding him) does
not hold that matter is infinitely divisible; and so I suppose
the seeds of matter&mdash;the ultimate molecules&mdash;are a kind of
<i>tertium quid</i> between matter and spirit. Certainly I can't
believe that any kind of matter, primal or ultimate, can be
<i>indivisible</i>, which it must according to his view.</p>

<p>Chalmers's treatise is, as to eloquence, surpassingly
beautiful; as to matter, I could not walk with him all the
way, although I longed to do it, for he walked on flowers,
and under shade&mdash;'no tree on which a fine bird did not
sit.' ...</p>

<p>Believe me, your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Sidmouth: September 14, [1834].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I won't ask you to forgive me for
not writing before, because I know very well that you would
rather have not heard from me immediately....
And so, you and Mrs. Mathew have been tearing to
pieces&mdash;to the very rags&mdash;all my elaborate theology! And
when Mr. Young is 'strong enough,' he is to help you at
your cruel work! 'The points upon which you and I
differed' are so numerous, that if I really <i>am</i> wrong upon
every one of them, Mrs. Mathew has indeed reason to
'punish me with hard thoughts.' Well, she can't help my
feeling for her much esteem, although I never saw her.
And if I <i>were</i> to see her, I would not argue with her; I
would only ask her to let me love her. I am weary of
controversy in religion, and should be so were I stronger
and more successful in it than I am or care to be. The
command is not 'argue with one another,' but 'love one
another.' It is better to love than to convince. They who
lie on the bosom of Jesus must lie there <i>together</i>!</p>

<p>Not a word about your book!<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Don't you mean to
tell me anything of it? I saw a review of it&mdash;rather a
satisfactory one&mdash;I think in an <i>August</i> number of the
'Athenaeum.' If you will look into 'Fraser's Magazine'
for August, at an article entitled 'Rogueries of Tom
Moore,' you will be amused with a notice of the 'Edinburgh
Review's' criticism in the text, and of yourself in a note.
We have had a crowded Bible meeting, and a Church
Missionary and London Missionary meeting besides; and I
went last Tuesday to the Exmouth Bible meeting with
Mrs. Maling, Miss Taylor, and Mr. Hunter. We did not
return until half-past one in the morning.... The Bishop
of Barbadoes and the Dean of Winchester were walking
together on the beach yesterday, making Sidmouth look
quite episcopal. You would not have despised it <i>half so
much</i>, had you been here.</p>

<p>Do you know any person who would like to send his
or her son to Sidmouth, for the sake of the climate, and
private instruction: and if you do, will you mention it to me?
I am very sorry to hear of Mrs. Boyd being so unwell.
Arabel had a letter two days ago from Annie, and as it
mentions Mrs. Boyd's having gone to Dover, I trust that
she is well again. Should she be returned, give my love to
her.</p>

<p>The black-edged paper may make you wonder at its
cause. Our dear aunt Mrs. Butler died last month at
Dieppe&mdash;and died <i>in Jesus</i>. Miss Clarke is going, if she
is not gone, to Italy for the winter.</p>

<p>Believe me, affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Write to me whenever you <i>dislike at least</i>, and tell me
what your plans are. I hear nothing about our leaving
Sidmouth.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Commeline</i><br />
September 22, 1834 [Sidmouth].<br />

<p>I am afraid that there can be no chance of my handwriting
at least being unforgotten by you, dear Miss
Commeline, but in the case of your having a very long
memory you may remember the name which shall be written
at the end of this note, and which belongs to one who does
not, nor is likely to forget you! I was much, <i>much</i> obliged
to you for the kind few lines you wrote to me&mdash;how long
ago! No, do not remember how long&mdash;do not remember
<i>that</i> for fear you should think me unkind, and&mdash;what I am
not! I have intended again and again to answer your note,
and I am doing it&mdash;<i>at last</i>! Are you all quite well?
Mrs. Commeline and all of you? Shall I ever see any of you
again? Perhaps I shall not; but even if I do not, I shall
not cease to wish you to be well and happy 'in the body or
out of the body.'</p>

<p>We came to Sidmouth for two months, and you see we
are here still; and when we are likely to go is as uncertain as
ever. I like the place, and some of its inhabitants. I like
the greenness and the tranquillity and the sea; and the
solitude of one dear seat which hangs over it, and which is
too far or too lonely for many others to like besides myself.
We are living in a thatched cottage, with a green lawn
bounded by a <i>Devonshire lane</i>. Do you know what that is?
Milton did when he wrote of 'hedgerow elms and hillocks
green.' Indeed Sidmouth is a nest among elms; and the
lulling of the sea and the shadow of the hills make it a peaceful
one. But there are no majestic features in the country. It is
all green and fresh and secluded; and the grandeur is concentrated
upon the ocean without deigning to have anything
to do with the earth. I often find my thoughts
where my footsteps once used to be! but there is no use in
speaking of that....</p>

<p>Pray believe me, affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Sidmouth: Friday, December 19, 1834 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;... We have lately had deep
anxiety with regard to our dear papa. He left us two months
ago to do his London business: and a few weeks since we
were told by a letter from him that he was ill; he giving us to
understand that his complaint was of a rheumatic character.
By the next coach, we were so daring (I can scarcely understand
how we managed it) as to send Henry to him: thinking
that it would be better to be scolded than to suffer him
to be alone and in suffering at a London hotel. We were
not scolded: but my prayer to be permitted to follow
Henry was condemned to silence: and what was said being
said emphatically, I was obliged to submit, and to be</p>

<p>thankful for the unsatisfactory accounts which for many days
afterwards we received.... I cannot help being anxious
and fearful. You know he is <i>all</i> left to us&mdash;and that without
him we should indeed be orphans and desolate. Therefore
you may well know what feelings those are with which we
look back upon his danger; and forwards to any threatening
of a return of it.... It may not be so. Do not, when
you write, allude to my fearing about it. Our only feeling
now should certainly be a deep feeling of thankfulness
towards that God of all consolation Who has permitted us
to know His love in the midst of many griefs; and Who
while He has often cast upon us the sorrow and the shadow,
has yet enabled us to recognise it as that 'shadow of the
wings of the Almighty,' wherein we may 'rejoice.' We
shall probably see our dear papa next week. At least we
know that he is only waiting for strength and that he is
already able to go out&mdash;I fear, not to <i>walk</i> out. Here we
are all well. Belle Vue is sold, and we shall probably have
to leave it in March: but I do not think that we shall do
so before. Henrietta is still very anxious to leave Sidmouth
altogether; and I still feel that I shall very much grieve to
leave it: so that it is happy for us that neither is the
<i>decider</i> on this point. I have often thought that it is
happier <i>not</i> to do what one pleases, and perhaps you will
agree with me&mdash;if you don't please at the present moment
to do something very particular. And do tell me, dear
Mrs. Martin, what you are pleasing to do, and what you are
doing: for it seems to me, and indeed is, a long time since
I heard of you and Mr. Martin <i>in detail</i>. Miss Maria
Commeline sent a note to Henrietta a fortnight ago: and
in it was honorable mention of you&mdash;but I won't interfere
with the sublimities of your imagination, by telling you what
it was.... I should like to hear something of Hope End:
whether there are many alterations, and whether the new
lodge, of which I heard, is built. Even now, the thought
stands before me sometimes like an object in a dream that
I shall see no more those hills and trees which seemed to
me once almost like portions of my existence. This is not
meant for murmuring. I have had much happiness at
Sidmouth, though with a character of its own. Henrietta
and Arabel and I are the only guardians just now of the
three youngest boys, the only ones at home: and I assure
you, we have not too little to do. They are no longer <i>little</i>
boys. There is an anxiety among us just now to have letters
from Jamaica&mdash;from my dear dear Bro&mdash;but the packet is
only 'expected.' The last accounts were comforting ones;
and I am living on the hope of seeing him back again in
the spring. Stormie and Georgie are doing well at Glasgow.
So Dr. Wardlaw says.... Henrietta's particular love to you;
and <i>do</i> believe me always,</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>You have of course heard of poor Mrs. Boyd's death.
Mr. Boyd and his daughter are both in London, and likely,
I think, to remain there.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Sidmouth: Tuesday [spring 1835].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;... Now I am going to tell you the
only good news I know, and you will be glad, I know, to
be told what I am going to tell you. Dear Georgie has
taken his degree, and very honorably, at Glasgow, and is
coming to us in all the dignity of a Bachelor of Arts. He
was examined in Logic, Moral Philosophy, Greek and
Latin, of course publicly: and we have heard from a
fellow student of his, that his answers were more pertinent
than those of any other of the examined, and elicited much
applause. Mr. Groube is the fellow student&mdash;but he has
ceased to be one, having found the Glasgow studies too
heavy for his health. Stormie shrank from the public
examination, on account of the hesitation in his speech.
He would not go up; although, according to report, as
well qualified as Georgie. Mr. Groube says that the ladies
of Glasgow are preparing to break their hearts for Georgie's
departure: and he and Stormie leave Glasgow on May I.
Now, I am sure you will rejoice with me in the result of
the examination. Do you not, dear friend? I was very
anxious about it; and almost resigned to hear of a failure&mdash;for
Georgie was in great alarm and prepared us for the
very worst. Therefore the surprise and pleasure were
great.</p>

<p>I can't tell you of our plans; although the Glasgow
students come to us in a week and this house will be too
small to receive them. We may leave Sidmouth immediately,
or not at all. I shall soon be quite qualified to
write a poem on the 'Pleasures of <i>Doubt</i>'&mdash;and a very good
subject it will be. The pleasures of certainty are generally
far less enjoyable&mdash;I mean as pleasures go in this unpleasing
world. Papa is in London, and much better when we
heard from him last&mdash;and we are awaiting his decree....</p>

<p>And now what remains for me to tell you? I believe I
have read more Hebrew than Greek lately; yet the dear
Greek is not less dear than ever. Who reads Greek to
you? Who holds my office? Some one, I hope, with an
articulation of more congenial slowness.</p>

<p>Give Annie my kind love. May God preserve both of
you!</p>

<p>Believe me, your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_II"></a><h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>1835-1841</h3>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<p>The residence of the Barretts at Sidmouth had never been
a very settled one&mdash;never intended to be permanent, and
yet never having a fixed term nor any reason for a fixed
term. Hence it spread itself gradually over a space of
nearly three years, before the long contemplated move to
London actually took place. During the latter part of that
period, however, extant letters of Miss Barrett are almost
wholly wanting, and there is little information from any
other source as to the course of her life. It was apparently
in the summer of 1835 that Sidmouth was finally left behind,
Mr. Barrett having then taken a house at 74 Gloucester
Place (near Baker Street), which, though never regarded as
more than a temporary residence, continued to be the home
of his family for the next three years.</p>

<p>The move to London was followed by two results of
great importance for Elizabeth Barrett. In the first place,
her health, which had never been strong, broke down
altogether in the London atmosphere, and it is from some
time shortly after the arrival in Gloucester Place that the
beginning of her invalid life must be dated. On the other
hand, residence in London brought her into the neighbourhood
of new friends; and although the number of those
admitted to see her in her sick-room was always small, we
yet owe to this fact the commencement of some of her
closest friendships, notably those with her distant cousin,
John Kenyon, and with Miss Mitford, the authoress of
'Our Village,' and of a correspondence on a much fuller
and more elaborate scale than any of the earlier period.
To this, no doubt, the fact of her confinement to her room
contributed not a little; for being unable to go out and see
her friends, much of her communication with them was
necessarily by letter. At the same time her literary activity
was increasing. She began to contribute poems to various
magazines, and to be brought thereby into connection with
literary men; and she was also employed on the longer
compositions which went to make up her next volume of
published verse.</p>

<p>All this was, however, only of gradual development;
and for some time her correspondence is limited to Mr.
Boyd, who was now living in St. John's Wood, and Mrs.
Martin. The exact date of the first letter is uncertain, but
it seems to belong to a time soon after the arrival of the
Barretts in town.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[74 Gloucester Place, London: autumn 1835.]<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;As Georgie is going to do what I
am afraid I shall not be able to do to-day&mdash;namely, to visit
<i>you</i>&mdash;he must take with him a few lines from <i>Porsonia</i>
<i>greeting</i>, to say how glad I am to feel myself again at only
a short distance from you, and how still gladder I shall be
when the same room holds both of us. Don't be angry
because I have not visited you immediately. You know&mdash;or
you <i>will</i> know, if you consider&mdash;I cannot open the
window and fly.</p>

<p>Papa and I were very much obliged to you for the
poison&mdash;and are ready to smile upon you whenever you
give us the opportunity, as graciously as Socrates did upon
his executioner. How much you will have to say to me
about the Greeks, unless you begin first to abuse me about
the <i>Romans</i>; and if you begin <i>that</i>, the peroration will be
a very pathetic one, in my being turned out of your doors.
Such is my prophecy.</p>

<p>Papa has been telling me of your abusing my stanzas on
Mrs. Hemans's death. I had a presentiment that you
would: and behold, why I said nothing to you of them.
Of course, I maintain, <i>versus</i> both you and papa, that they
are very much to be admired: as well as everything else
proceeding from or belonging to ME. Upon which
principle, I hope you will admire George particularly.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Mr. Boyd, your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Arabel's and my love to Annie. Won't she come to see
us?</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
74 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London: Jan. I, 1836.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I am half willing and half
unwilling to write to you when, among such dearer interests
and deep anxieties, you may perhaps be scarcely at liberty
to attend to what I write. And yet I <i>will</i> write, if it
be only briefly, that you may not think&mdash;if you think of us
at all&mdash;that we have changed our hearts with our residence so
much as to forget to sympathise with you, dear Mrs. Martin,
or to neglect to apprise you ourselves of our movements.
Indeed, a letter to you should have been written among my
first letters on arriving in London, only Henrietta (my
scape-goat, <i>you</i> will say) said, '<i>I</i> will write to Mrs.
Martin.' And then after I had waited, and determined to write
without waiting any longer, we heard of poor Mrs.
Hanford's affliction and your anxiety, and I have considered
day after day whether or not I should intrude upon you;
until I find myself&mdash;<i>thus</i>!</p>

<p>I do hope that you have from the hand of God those
consolations which only He in Jesus Christ can give to the
so afflicted. For I know well that you are afflicted with
the afflicted, and that with you sympathy is suffering; and
that while the tenderest earthly comfort is administered by
your presence and kindness to your dear friends, you will
feel bitterly for them what a little thing earthly comfort is,
when the earthly beloved perish before them. May He who
is the Beloved in the sight of His Father and His Church
be near to them and you, and cause you to <i>feel</i> as well
as <i>know</i> the truth, that what is sudden sorrow, to our
judgments, is only long-prepared mercy in <i>His</i> will whose
names are <i>Wisdom</i> and <i>Love</i>. Should it not be, dear
friend, that the tears of our human eyes ought to serve the
happy and touching purpose of reminding us of those
tears of Jesus which He shed in assuming our sorrow with
our flesh? And the memory of those tears involves all
comfort. A recognition of the oneness of the human nature
of that Divine Saviour who ever liveth, with ours which
perishes and sorrows so; an assurance drawn from thence
of <i>His</i> sympathy who sits on the throne of God, with us
who suffer in the dust of earth, and of all those doctrines
of redemption and sanctification and happiness which come
from Him and by Him.</p>

<p>Now you will forgive me for writing all this, dearest
Mrs. Martin. I like to write my thoughts and feelings out
of my own head and heart, just as they suggest themselves,
when I write to you; and I cannot think of affliction, particularly
when it comes near to me in the affliction or anxiety
of dear friends, without looking back and remembering
what voice of God used to sound softly to me when none other
could speak comfort. You will forgive me, and not be angry
with me for trying, or seeming to try, to be a sermon writer.</p>

<p>Perhaps, dear Mrs. Martin, when you do feel inclined
and able to write, you would write me a few lines.
Remember, I do not ask for them <i>now</i>. No, do not think
of writing now. I shall very much like to hear how your
dear charge is&mdash;whether there should appear any prospect of
improvement; and how poor Mrs. Hanford bears up against
this heavy calamity; and whether the anxiety and nursing
affect your health. But we shall try to hear this from the
Biddulphs; and so do put me out of your head, except
when its thoughts would dwell on those on earth who
sympathise with you and care for you.</p>

<p>You see we are in London after all, and poor Sidmouth
left afar. I am almost inclined to say 'poor us' instead of
'poor Sidmouth.' But I dare say I shall soon be able
to see in my dungeon, and begin to be amused with
the spiders. Half my soul, in the meantime, seems to
have stayed behind on the seashore, which I love more
than ever now that I cannot walk on it in the body.
London is wrapped up like a mummy, in a yellow mist, so
closely that I have had scarcely a glimpse of its countenance
since we came. Well, I am trying to like it all very much,
and I dare say that in time I may change my taste and my
senses&mdash;and succeed. We are in a house large enough to
hold us, for four months, at the end of which time, if the experiment
of our being able to live in London succeed, I <i>believe</i>
that papa's intention is to take an unfurnished house and
have his furniture from Ledbury. You may wonder at me,
but I wish that were settled <i>so</i>, and <i>now</i>. I am
<i>satisfied</i> with London, although I cannot enjoy it.
We are not likely, in the case of leaving it, to return to
Devonshire, and I should look with weary eyes to another
strangership and pilgrimage even among green fields that
know not these fogs. Papa's object in settling here refers
to my brothers. George will probably enter as a barrister
student at the Inner Temple on the fifth or sixth of this
month, and he will have the advantage of his home by our
remaining where we are. Another advantage of London is, that
we shall see here those whom we might see nowhere else. This
year, dear Mrs. Martin, may it bring with it the true pleasure
of seeing <i>you</i>! Three have gone, and we have not seen
you.... May God bless you and all that you care for,
being with you always as the God of consolation and
peace.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>It is from the middle of this year that Miss Barrett's
active appearance as an author may be dated. Hitherto her
publications had been confined to a few small anonymous
volumes, printed rather to please herself and her friends
than with any idea of appealing to a wider public. She
was now anxious to take this farther step, and, with that
object, to obtain admission to some of the literary
magazines. This was obtained through the instrumentality
of Mr. R.H. Home, subsequently best known as the
author of 'Orion.' He was at this time personally unknown
to Miss Barrett, but an application through a common friend
led both to the opening to the poetess of the pages of the
'New Monthly Magazine,' then edited by Bulwer, and also
to the commencement of a friendship which has left its mark
in the two volumes of published letters to Mr. Home. The
following is Mr. Home's account of the opening of the
acquaintance ('Letters,' i. 7, 8):</p>


<blockquote><p>'My first introduction to Miss Barrett was by a note
from Mrs. Orme, inclosing one from the young lady containing
a short poem with the modest request to be frankly
told whether it might be ranked as poetry or merely verse.
As there could be no doubt in the recipient's mind on that
point, the poem was forwarded to Colburn's &quot;New Monthly,&quot;
edited at that time by Mr. Bulwer (afterwards the late [first]
Lord Lytton), where it duly appeared in the current number.
The next manuscript sent to me was &quot;The Dead Pan,&quot; and
the poetess at once started on her bright and noble career.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The poem with which Miss Barrett thus made her bow
to the world of letters was 'The Romaunt of Margret,'<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
which appeared in the July number of the magazine.
Mr. Home must, however, have been in error in speaking
of 'The Dead Pan' as its successor, since that was not
written till some years later. More probably it was 'The
Poet's Vow,<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> which was printed in the October number of
the 'New Monthly.'</p><br />

[London:] October 14, Friday [1836].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;Be as little angry with me as you can.
I have not been very well for a day or two, and shall enjoy a
visit to you on Monday so much more than I shall be able
to do to-day, that I will ask you to forgive my not going to you
this week, and to receive me kindly on that day instead&mdash;provided,
you know, it is not wet.</p>

<p>The &#945;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#962; [Achaiides] approach the &#945;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#953; [Achaioi]<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> more tremblingly
than usual, with the 'New Monthly Magazine' in their hands.
Now pray don't annoy yourself by reading a single word
which you would rather not read except for the sake of
being kind to me. And my prophecy is, that even by
annoying yourself and making a <i>strenuous</i> effort, the whole
force of friendship would not carry you down the first
page. Georgie says you want to know the verdict of the
'Athenaeum.' That paper unfortunately has been lent out
of the house; but my memory enables me to send you the
words very correctly, I think. After some observations on
other periodicals, the writer goes on to say: 'The &quot;New
Monthly Magazine&quot; has not one heavy article. It is rich
in poetry, including some fine sonnets by the Corn Law
Rhymer, and a fine although too dreamy ballad, &quot;The
Poet's Vow.&quot; We are almost tempted to pause and criticise
the work of a writer of so much inspiration and promise as
the author of this poem, and exhort him once again, to
greater clearness of expression and less quaintness in the
choice of his phraseology; but this is not the time or place
for digression.'</p>

<p>You see my critic has condemned me with a very
gracious countenance. Do put on yours,</p>

And believe me, affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.<br />
<br />

<p>I forgot to say that you surprised and pleased me at the
same time by your praise of my 'Sea-mew.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Love to Annie.
We were glad to hear that she did not <i>continue</i> unwell, and
that you are well again, too. I hope you have had no return
of the rheumatic pain.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[74 Gloucester Place:] Saturday, [October 1836].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I am much disappointed in finding
myself at the end of this week without having once seen
you&mdash;particularly when your two notes are waiting all this
time to be answered. Do believe that they were not, either
of them, addressed to an ungrateful person, and that the
only reason of their being received <i>silently</i> was my hope of
answering them more agreeably to both of us&mdash;by talking
instead of writing.</p>

<p>Yes; you have read my mystery.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p>You paid a tithe to your human nature in reading only
<i>nine-tenths</i> of it, and the rest was a pure gift to your friendship
for me, and is taken and will be remembered as such.
But you have a cruel heart for a parody, and this one tried
my sensibility so much that I cried&mdash;with laughing. I
confess to you notwithstanding, it was <i>very fair</i>, and dealt
its blow with a shining pointed weapon.</p>

<p>But what will you say to me when I confess besides
that, in the face of all your kind encouragement, my Drama
of the Angels<a name="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> has never been touched until the last three
days? It was <i>not</i> out of pure idleness on my part, nor of
disregard to your admonition; but when my thoughts were
distracted with other things, books just begun inclosing me
all around, a whole load of books upon my conscience, I
could not possibly rise up to the gate of heaven and write
about my angels. You know one can't sometimes sit down
to the sublunary, occupation of reading Greek, unless one
feels <i>free</i> to it. And writing poetry requires a double liberty,
and an inclination which comes only of itself.</p>

<p>But I have begun. I tried the blank metre once, and
it <i>would not do</i>, and so I had to begin again in lyrics.
Something above an hundred lines is written, and now I
am in two panics, just as if one were not enough. First,
because it seems to me a very daring subject&mdash;a subject
almost beyond our sympathies, and therefore quite beyond
the sphere of human poetry. Perhaps when all is written
courageously, I shall have no courage left to publish it.
Secondly, because all my tendencies towards mysticism will
be called into terrible operation by this dreaming upon
angels. Yes; you <i>will</i> read a mystery,
but don't make any rash resolutions about reading anything.
As I have begun, I certainly will go on with the writing.</p>

<p>Here is a question for you:</p>

<p>Am I to accept your generous sacrifice of reading nine-tenths
of my 'Vow,' as an atonement for your WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ME?
Oh, your conscience will understand very well what I mean, without
a dictionary.</p>

<p>Arabel and I intend to pay you a visit on Monday, and
if we can, and it is convenient to you, we are inclined to
invite ourselves to your dinner table. But this is all
dependent on the weather.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Mr. Boyd, your affectionate friend,<br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[74 Gloucester Place:] November 26, 1836 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I have been so busy that I have
not been able until this morning to take breath or <i>inspiration</i>
to answer your lyrics. You shall see me soon, but I am
sorry to say it can't be Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>I have had another note from the editor of the 'New
Monthly Magazine'&mdash;very flattering, and praying for farther
supplies. The Angels were not ready, and I was obliged
to send something else, which I will not ask you to read. So
don't be very uneasy.</p>

a great hurry, for I won't miss this post,</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
74 Gloucester Place: December 7, 1836.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Indeed I have long felt the
need of writing to you (I mean the need to myself), and
although so many weeks and even months have passed away
in silence, they have not done so in lack of affection and
thought.</p>

<p>I had wished very much to have been able to tell you in
this letter where we had taken our house, or where we were
going to take it. We remain, however, in our usual state
of conscious ignorance, although there is a good deal of
talking and walking about a house in Wimpole Street&mdash;which,
between ourselves, I am not very anxious to live in,
on account of the gloominesses of that street, and of that part
of the street, whose walls look so much like Newgate's turned
inside out. I would rather go on, in my old way, inhabiting
castles in the air than that particular house. Nevertheless,
if it <i>is</i> decided upon, I dare say I shall contrive to be satisfied
with it, and sleep and wake very much as I should in
any other. It will certainly be a point gained to be settled
somewhere, and I do so long to sit in my own armchair&mdash;strange
as it will look out of my own room&mdash;and to read
from my own books.... For our own particular parts, our
healths continue good&mdash;none of us, I think, the worse for
fog or wind. As to wind, we were almost elevated into the
prerogative of <i>pigs</i> in the late storm. We could almost <i>see</i>
it, and the feeling it might have been fatal to us. Bro and
I were moralising about shipwrecks, in the dining-room,
when down came the chimney through the skylight into the
entrance passage. You may imagine the crashing effect of
the bricks bounding from the staircase downwards, breaking
the stone steps in the process, in addition to the falling in
of twenty-four large panes of glass, frames and all. We
were terrified out of all propriety, and there has been a
dreadful calumny about Henrietta and me&mdash;that we had
the hall door open for the purpose of going out into the
street with our hair on end, if Bro had not <i>encouraged</i> us by
shutting the door and locking it. I confess to opening the
door, but deny the purpose of it&mdash;at least, maintain that I
only meant to keep in reserve a way of escape, <i>in case</i>, as
seemed probable, the whole house was on its way to the
ground. Indeed, we should think much of the <i>mercy</i> of
the escape. Bro had been on the staircase only five
minutes before. Sarah the housemaid was actually there.
She looked up accidentally and saw the nodding chimneys,
and ran down into the drawing-room to papa, shrieking, but
escaping with one graze of the hand from one brick. How
did <i>you</i> fare in the wind? I never much imagined before
that anything so true to nature as a real live storm could
make itself heard in our streets. But it has come too
surely, and carried away with it, besides our chimney, all that
was left to us of the country, in the shape of the Kensington
Garden trees. Now do write to me, dearest Mrs. Martin,
and soon, and tell me all you can of your chances and
mischances, and how Mr. Martin is getting on with the
parish, and yourself with the parishioners. But you have
more the name of living at Colwall than the thing. You
seem to me to lead a far more wandering life than we, for
all our homelessness and 'pilgrim shoon.' Why, you have
been in Ireland since I last said a word to you, even upon
paper....</p>

<p>I sometimes think that a pilgrim's life is the wisest&mdash;at
least, the most congenial to the 'uses of this world.' We
give our sympathies and associations to our hills and fields,
and then the providence of God gives <i>them</i> to another,
It is better, perhaps, to keep a stricter <i>identity</i>, by calling
only our thoughts our own.</p>

<p>Was there anybody in the world who ever loved London for
itself? Did Dr. Johnson, in his paradise of Fleet Street,
love the pavement and the walls? I doubt <i>that</i>&mdash;whether
I ought to do so or not&mdash;though I don't doubt at all that one
may be contented and happy here, and love much <i>in</i> the
place. But the place and the privileges of it don't mix together
in one's love, as is done among the hills and by the seaside.</p>

<p>I or Henrietta must have told you that one of my
privileges has been to see Wordsworth twice. He was very
kind to me, and let me hear his conversation. I went with
him and Miss Mitford to Chiswick, and thought all the way
that I must certainly be dreaming. I saw her almost every
day of her week's visit to London (this was all long ago,
while you were in France); and she, who overflows with
warm affections and generous benevolences, showed me every
present and absent kindness, professing to love me, and
asking me to write to her. Her novel is to be published
soon after Christmas, and I believe a new tragedy is to appear
about the same time, 'under the protection of Mr. Forrest.'
Papa has given me the first two volumes of Wordsworth's
new edition. The engraving in the first is his <i>own face</i>.
You might think me affected if I told you all I felt in seeing
the living face. His manners are very simple, and his
conversation not at all <i>prominent</i>&mdash;if you quite understand
what I mean by <i>that</i>. I do myself, for I saw at the same
time Landor&mdash;the brilliant Landor!&mdash;and <i>felt</i> the difference
between great genius and eminent talent; All these visions
have passed now. I hear and see nothing, except my doves
and the fireplace, and am doing little else than [<i>words torn
out</i>] write all day long. And then people ask me what
I <i>mean</i> in [<i>words torn out</i>]. I hope you were among the
six who understood or half understood my 'Poet's Vow'&mdash;that
is, if you read it at all. Uncle Hedley made a long
pause at the first part. But I have been reading, too,
Sheridan Knowles's play of the 'Wreckers.' It is full of
passion and pathos, and made me shed a great many tears.
How do you get on with the reading society? Do you see
much or anything of Lady Margaret Cocks, from whom I
never hear now? I promised to let her have 'Ion,' if I
could, before she left Brighton, but the person to whom it
was lent did not return it to me in time. Will you tell her
this, if you do see her, and give her my kind regards at
the same time? Dear Bell was so sorry not to have seen
you. If she had, you would have thought her looking <i>very</i>
well, notwithstanding the thinness&mdash;perhaps, in some measure,
on account of it&mdash;and in <i>eminent</i> spirits. I have not
seen her in such spirits for very, very long. And there she
is, down at Torquay, with the Hedleys and Butlers, making
quite a colony of it, and everybody, in each several letter,
grumbling in an undertone at the dullness of the place.
What would <i>I</i> give to see the waves once more! But
perhaps if I were there, I should grumble too. It is a
happiness to them to be <i>together</i>, and that, I am sure, they
all feel....</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[74 Gloucester Place:]<br />
Thursday, December 15, 1836 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;... Two mornings since, I saw in
the paper, under the head of literary news, that a change of
editorship was taking place in the 'New Monthly Magazine;'
and that Theodore Hook was to preside in the room of Mr.
Hall. I am so much too modest and too wise to expect
the patronage of two editors in succession, that I expect
both my poems in a return cover, by every twopenny post.
Besides, what has Theodore Hook to do with Seraphim?
So, I shall leave that poem of mine to your imagination;
which won't be half as troublesome to you as if I asked you
to read it; begging you to be assured&mdash;to write it down in
your critical rubric&mdash;that it is the very finest composition you
ever read, <i>next</i> (of course) to the beloved 'De Virginitate'
of Gregory Nazianzen.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p>Mr. Stratten has just been here. I admire him more
than I ever did, for his admiration of my doves. By the
way, I am sure he thought them the most agreeable of the
whole party; for he said, what he never did before, that he
could sit here for an hour! Our love to Annie&mdash;and forgive
me for Baskettiring a letter to you. I mean, of course,
as to size, not type.</p>
<br />
<p>Yours affectionately,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Is your poem printed yet?</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[74 Gloucester Place:] Tuesday [Christmas 1836].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you for the
<i>two</i> copies of your poem, so beautifully printed, with such
'majestical' types, on such 'magnifical' paper, as to be
almost worthy of Baskett himself. You are too liberal in
sending me more than one copy; and pray accept in return
a duplicate of gratitude.</p>

<p>As to my 'Seraphim,' they are not returned to me, as in
the case of their being unaccepted, I expressly begged they
might be. Had the old editor been the present one, my
inference would of course be, that their insertion was a
determined matter; but as it is, I don't know what to
think.<a name="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> A long list of great names, belonging to <i>intending</i>
contributors, appeared in the paper a day or two ago, and
among them was Miss Mitford's.</p>

<p>Are you wroth with me for not saying a word about going
to see you? Arabel and I won't affirm it mathematically&mdash;but
we are, metaphysically, <i>talking</i> of paying our visit to
you next Tuesday. Don't expect us, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Yours affectionately,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>What are my Christmas good wishes to be? That you
may hold a Field in your right hand, and a Baskerville in
your left, before the year is out! That degree of happiness
will satisfy at least the <i>bodily</i> part of you.</p>

<p>You may wish, in return, for <i>me</i>, that I may learn to
write rather more legibly than 'at these presents.'</p>

<p>Our love to Annie.</p>

<p>Won't you send your new poem to Mr. Barker, to the
care of Mr. Valpy, with your Christmas benedictions?</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i>.<br />
[74 Gloucester Place:] January 23, 1837 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I am standing in Henrietta's place,
she says&mdash;but not, <i>I</i> say, to answer your letter to <i>her</i>
yesterday, but your letter to <i>me</i>, some weeks ago&mdash;which I
meant to answer much more immediately if the <i>ignis fatuus</i>
of a house (you see to what a miserable fatuity I am
reduced, of applying your pure country metaphors to our
brick pollutions) had not been gliding just before us, and I
had not much wished to be able to tell you of our settlement.
As it is, however, I must write, and shall keep a
solemn silence on the solemn subject of our shifting
plans....</p>

<p>No! I was not at all disappointed in Wordsworth,
although perhaps I should not have singled him from the
multitude as a great man. There is a <i>reserve</i> even in his
countenance, which does not lighten as Landor's does,
whom I saw the same evening. His eyes have more meekness
than brilliancy; and in his slow even articulation
there is rather the solemnity and calmness of <i>truth</i> itself,
than the animation and energy of those who seek for it.
As to my being quite at my ease when I spoke to him,
why how could you ask such a question? I trembled
both in my soul and body. But he was very kind, and sate
near me and talked to me as long as he was in the room&mdash;and
recited a translation by Cary of a sonnet of Dante's&mdash;and
altogether, it was quite a dream! Landor too&mdash;Walter
Savage Landor ... in whose hands the ashes of
antiquity burn again&mdash;gave me two Greek epigrams he had lately
written ... and talked brilliantly and prominently until Bro (he
and I went together) abused him for <i>ambitious</i> singularity
and affectation. But it was very interesting. And dear Miss
Mitford too! and Mr. Raymond, a great Hebraist and the ancient
author of 'A Cure for a Heartache!' I never walked in the
skies before; and perhaps never shall again, when so many
stars are out! I shall at least see dear Miss Mitford, who
wrote to me not long ago to say that she would soon be in
London with 'Otto,' her new tragedy, which was written at
Mr. Forrest's own request, he in the most flattering manner
having applied to her a stranger, as the authoress of 'Rienzi,'
for a dramatic work worthy of his acting&mdash;after rejecting
many plays offered to him, and among them Mr. Knowles's....
She says that her play will be quite opposed, in its
execution, to 'Ion,' as unlike it 'as a ruined castle
overhanging the Rhine, to a Grecian temple.' And I do not
doubt that it will be full of ability; although my own
opinion is that she stands higher as the authoress of 'Our
Village' than of 'Rienzi,' and writes prose better than poetry,
and transcends rather in Dutch minuteness and high finishing,
than in Italian ideality and passion. I think besides
that Mr. Forrest's rejection of any play of Sheridan Knowles
must refer rather to its unfitness for the development of his
own personal talent, than to its abstract demerit, whatever
Transatlantic tastes he may bring with him. The published
title of the last play is 'The Daughter,' not 'The Wreckers,'
although I believe it was acted as the last. I am very
anxious to read 'Otto,' not to <i>see</i> it. I am not going to
see it, notwithstanding an offered temptation to sit in the
authoress's own box. With regard to 'Ion,' I think it is a
beautiful work, but beautiful <i>rather</i> morally than
intellectually. Is this right or not? Its moral tone is very
noble, and sends a grand and touching harmony into the
midst of the full discord of this utilitarian age. As dramatic
<i>poetry</i>, it seems to me to want, not beauty, but power,
passion, and condensation. This is my <i>doxy</i> about 'Ion.'
Its author<a name="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> made me very proud by sending it to me, although
we do not know him personally. I have <i>heard</i> that he is a
most amiable man (who else could have written 'Ion'?), but
that he was a little <i>elevated</i> by his popularity last year!...</p>

<p>I have read Combe's 'Phrenology,' but not the 'Constitution
of Man.' The 'Phrenology' is very clever, and amusing;
but I do not think it logical or satisfactory. I forget
whether 'slowness of the pulse' <i>is</i> mentioned in it as a
symptom of the poetical aestus. I am afraid, if it be a
symptom, I dare not take my place even in the 'forlorn hope
of poets' in this age so forlorn as to its poetry; for my pulse
is in a continual flutter and my feet not half cold enough
for a pedestal&mdash;so I must make my honours over to poor
papa straightway. He has been shivering and shuddering
through the cold weather; and partaking our influenza in
the warmer. I am very sorry that you should have been a
sufferer too. It seems to have been a universal pestilence,
even down in Devonshire, where dear Bummy and the
whole colony have had their share of 'groans.' And one of
my doves shook its pretty head and ruffled its feathers and
shut its eyes, and became subject to pap and nursing and
other infirmities for two or three days, until I was in great
consternation for the result. But it is well again&mdash;cooing as
usual; and so indeed we all are. But indeed, I can't write
a sentence more without saying some of the evil it deserves&mdash;of
the utilitarianisms of this corrupt age&mdash;among some of
the chief of which are steel pens!</p>

<p>I am so glad that you liked my 'Romaunt,' and so
resigned that you did not understand some of my 'Poet's
Vow,' and so obliged that you should care to go on reading
what I write. They vouchsafed to publish in the first
number of the new series of the 'New Monthly' a little
poem of mine called 'The Island,'<a name="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> but so incorrectly that I
was glad at the additional oblivion of my signature. If you
see it, pray alter the last senseless line of the first page into
'Leaf sounds with water, in your ear,' and put 'amreeta'
instead of 'amneta' on the second page; and strike out '<i>of</i>'
in the line which names Aeschylus! There are other
blunders, [but] these are intolerable, and cast me out of my
'contentment' for some time. I have begged for [proof]
sheets in future; and as none have come for the ensuing
month, I suppose I shall have nothing in the next number.
They have a lyrical dramatic poem of mine, 'The Two
Seraphim,' which, whenever it appears, I shall like to have
your opinion of. As to the incomprehensible line in the
'Poet's Vow' of which you asked me the meaning, 'One
making one in strong compass,' I meant to express how
that oneness of God, 'in whom are all things,' produces a
oneness or sympathy (sympathy being the tendency of many
to become one) in all things. Do you understand? or is
the explanation to be explained? The unity of God
preserves a unity in men&mdash;that is, a perpetual sympathy
between man and man&mdash;which sympathy we must be subject
to, if not in our joys, yet in our griefs. I believe the subject
itself involves the necessity of some mysticism; but I must
make no excuses. I am afraid that my very Seraphim will
not be thought to stand in a very clear light, even at
heaven's gate. But this is much <i>asay</i> about nothing ...</p>

<p>The Bishop of Exeter is staying and preaching at
Torquay. Do you not envy them all for making part of
his congregation? I am sure I do <i>as much</i>. I envy you
your before-breakfast activity. I am never a <i>complete man</i>
without my breakfast&mdash;it seems to be some integral part of
my soul. <i>You</i> 'read all O'Connell's speeches.' I never
read any of them&mdash;unless they take me by surprise. I keep
my devotion for <i>unpaid</i> patriots; but Miss Mitford is another
devotee of Mr. O'Connell ...</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin's affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Thank you for the 'Ba' in Henrietta's letter. If you
knew how many people, whom I have known only within
this year or two, whether I like them or not, say 'Ba, Ba,'
quite naturally and pastorally, you would not come to me
with the detestable 'Miss B.'</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
London: August 16, 1837.<br />

<p>My dear Mrs. Martin,&mdash;It seems a long long time since
we had any intercourse; and the answer to your last
pleasant letter to Henrietta <i>must</i> go to you from me. We
have heard of you that you don't mean to return to England
before the spring&mdash;which news proved me a prophet, and
disappointed me at the same time, for one can't enjoy even
a prophecy in this world without something vexing. Indeed,
I do long to see you again, dearest Mrs. Martin, and should
always have the same pleasure in it, and affection for you,
if my friends and acquaintances were as much multiplied as
you <i>wrongly</i> suppose them to be. But the truth is that I
have almost none at all, in this place; and, except our
relative Mr. Kenyon, not one literary in any sense. Dear
Miss Mitford, one of the very kindest of human beings, lies
buried in geraniums, thirty miles away. I could not conceive
what Henrietta had been telling you, or what you
meant, for a long time&mdash;until we conjectured that it must
have been something about Lady Dacre, who kindly sent
me her book, and intimated that she would be glad to receive
me at her conversations&mdash;and you know me better than to
doubt whether I would go or not. There was an equal
unworthiness and unwillingness towards the honor of it.
Indeed, dearest Mrs. Martin, it is almost surprising how we
contrive to be as dull in London as in Devonshire&mdash;perhaps
more so, for the sight of a multitude induces a sense of
seclusion which one has not without it; and, besides, there
were at Sidmouth many more known faces and listened-to
voices than we see and hear in this place. No house yet!
And you will scarcely have patience to read that papa has
seen and likes another house in Devonshire Place, and that
he <i>may</i> take it, and we <i>may</i> be settled in it, before the year
closes. I myself think of the whole business indifferently.
My thoughts have turned so long on the subject of houses,
that the pivot is broken&mdash;and now they won't turn any more.
All that remains is, a sort of consciousness, that we should
be more comfortable in a house with cleaner carpets, and
taken for rather longer than a week at a time. Perhaps,
after all, we are quite as well <i>sur le tapis</i> as it is. It is a
thousand to one but that the feeling of four red London
walls closing around us for seven, eleven, or twenty-five years,
would be a harsh and hard one, and make us cry wistfully
to 'get out.' I am sure you will look up to your mountains,
and down to your lakes, and enter into this conjecture.</p>

<p>Talking of mountains and lakes is itself a trying thing
to us poor prisoners. Papa has talked several times of
taking us into the country for two months this summer, and
we have dreamt of it a hundred times in addition; but,
after all, we are not likely to go I dare say. It would have
been very delightful&mdash;and who knows what may take place
next summer? We may not absolutely <i>die</i>, without seeing
a tree. Henrietta has seen a great many. You will have
heard, I dare say, of the enjoyment she had in her week at
Camden House. She seems to have walked from seven in
the morning to seven at night; and was quite delighted with
the kindness within doors and the sunshine without. I
assure you that, fresh as she was from the air and dew, she
saluted us amidst the sentiment of our sisterly meeting just
in this way&mdash;it was almost her first exclamation&mdash;'What a
very disagreeable smell there is here!' And this, although
she had brought geraniums enough from Camden to perfume
the Haymarket!...</p>

<p>I am happy to announce to you that a new little dove
has appeared from a shell&mdash;over which nobody had prognosticated
good&mdash;on August 16, 1837. I and the senior doves appear equally
delighted, and we all three, in the capacity of good sitters
and indefatigable pullers-about, take a good deal of credit
upon ourselves....</p>

<p>Arabel has begun oil painting, and without a master&mdash;and
you can't think how much effect and expression she has
given to several of her own sketches, notwithstanding all
difficulties. Poor Henrietta is without a piano, and is not
to have one again <i>until we have another house</i>! This is something
like 'when Homer and Virgil are forgotten.' <i>Speaking
of Homer and Virgil</i>, I have been writing a 'Romance
of the Ganges,'<a name="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> in order to illustrate an engraving in the
new annual to be edited by Miss Mitford, Finden's tableaux
for 1838. It does not sound a <i>very</i> Homeric undertaking&mdash;I
confess I don't hold any kind of annual, gild it as you
please, in too much honour and awe&mdash;but from my wish to
please her, and from the necessity of its being done in a
certain time, I was 'quite frightful,' as poor old Cooke used
to say, in order to express his own nervousness. But she
was quite pleased&mdash;she is very soon pleased&mdash;and the ballad,
gone the way of all writing, now-a-days, to the press. I do
wish I could send you some kind of news that would interest
you; but you see scarcely any except all this selfishness is
in my beat. Dearest Bro draws and reads German, and I
fear is dull notwithstanding. But we are every one of us
more reconciled to London than we were. Well! I must
not write any more. Whenever you think of me, dearest
Mrs. Martin, remember how deeply and unchangeably I
must regard you&mdash;both with my <i>mind</i>, my <i>affections</i>,
and that part of either, called my gratitude. BA.</p>

<p>Henrietta's kindest love and thanks for your letter. She
desires me to say that she and Bro are going to dine with
Mrs. Robert Martin to-morrow. I must tell you that
Georgie and I went to hear Dr. Chalmers preach, three
Sundays ago. His sermon was on a text whose extreme
beauty would diffuse itself into any sermon preached upon it&mdash;God
is love. His eloquence was very great, and his views
noble and grasping. I expected much from his imagination,
but not so much from his knowledge. It was truer to
Scripture than I was prepared for, although there seemed
to me some <i>want</i> on the subject of the work of the Holy
Spirit on the heart, which work we cannot dwell upon too
emphatically. 'He worketh in us to will and to do,' and
yet we are apt to will and do without a transmission of the
praise to Him. May God bless you.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Commeline</i><br />
London: August 19, 1837.<br />

<p>My dear Miss Commeline,&mdash;I could not hear of your
being in affliction without very frequent thoughts of you
and a desire to express some of them in this way, and
although so much time has passed I do hope that you will
believe in the sympathy with which I, or rather <i>we</i>, have
thought of you, and in the regard we shall not cease to feel
for you even if we meet no more in this world. It is
blessed to know both for ourselves and for each other that
while there is a darkness that <i>must</i> come to all, there is a
light which <i>may</i>; and may He who is the light in the dark
place be with you [now] and always, causing you to feel
rather the glory that is in Him than the shadow which is in
all beside&mdash;that so the sweetness of the consolation may pass
the bitterness of even grief. Do give my love to Mrs.
Commeline and to your sisters, and believe me, all of you,
that the friends who have gone from your neighbourhood
have not gone from my old remembrance, either of your
kindness to them, or of their own feelings of interest in
you.</p>

<p>Trusting to such old remembrances, I will believe that
you care to know what we are doing and how we are
settling&mdash;that word which has now been on our lips for
years, which it is marvellous to think how it got upon
human lips at all. We came from Sidmouth to try London
and ourselves, and see whether or not we could live
together; and after more than a year and a half close contact
with smoke we find no very good excuse for not remaining
in it; and papa is going on with his eternal hunt for houses&mdash;the
wild huntsman in the ballad is nothing to him, all
except the sublimity&mdash;intending very seriously to take the
first he can. He is now about one in particular, but I won't
tell where it is because we have considered so many houses
in particular that our considerations have come to be a jest
in general. I shall be heartily glad, at least I <i>think</i> so, for
it is possible that the reality of being bricked up for a lease
time may not be very agreeable. I think I shall be heartily
glad when a house is taken, and we have made it look like
our own with our furniture and pictures and books. I am
so anxious to see my old books. I believe I shall begin at
the beginning and read every story book through in the joy of
meeting, and shall be as sedentary as ever I was in my own
arm-chair. I remember when I was a child spreading my
vitality, not over trees and flowers (I do that still&mdash;I still
believe they have a certain animal susceptibility to pleasure
and pain; 'it is my creed,' and, being Wordsworth's besides, I
am not ashamed of it), but over chairs and tables and books
in particular, and being used to fancy a kind of love in them
to suit my love to them. And so if I were a child I should
have an intense pity for my poor folios, quartos, and
duodecimos, to say nothing of the arm-chair, shut up all
these weeks and months in boxes, without a rational eye to
look upon them. Pray forgive me if I have written a great
deal of nonsense&mdash;'Je m'en doute.'</p>

<p>Henrietta has spent a fortnight at Chislehurst with the
Martins, and was very joyous there, and came back to us
with that happy triumphant air which I always fancy people
'just from the country' put on towards us hapless
Londoners.</p>

<p>But you must not think I am a discontented person and
grumble all day long at being in London. <i>There are many
advantages here</i>, as I say to myself whenever it is particularly
disagreeable; and if we can't see even a leaf or a sparrow
without soot on it, there are the parrots at the Zoological
Gardens and the pictures at the Royal Academy; and real
live poets above all, with their heads full of the trees and
birds and sunshine of paradise. I have stood face to face
with Wordsworth and Landor; and Miss Mitford, who is in
herself what she is in her books, has become a dear friend of
mine, but a distant one. She visits London at long intervals,
and lives thirty miles away....</p>

<p>Bro and I were studying German together all last
summer with Henry, before he left us to become a German,
and I believe this is the last of my languages, for I have
begun absolutely to detest the sight of a dictionary or
grammar, which I never liked except as a means, and love
poetry with an intenser love, if that be possible, than I ever
did. Not that Greek is not as dear to me as ever, but I
write more than I read, even of Greek poetry, and am
resolute to work whatever little faculty I have, clear of
imitations and conventionalisms which cloud and weaken
more poetry (particularly now-a-days) than would be
believed possible without looking into it....</p>

<p>As to society in London, I assure you that none of us
have much, and that as for me, you would wonder at seeing
how possible it is to live as secludedly in the midst of a
multitude as in the centre of solitude. My doves are my
chief acquaintances, and I am so very intimate with <i>them</i>
that they accept and even demand my assistance in building
their innumerable nests. Do tell me if there is any hope of
seeing any of you in London at any time. I say 'do tell
me,' for I will venture to ask you, dear Miss Commeline, to
write me a few lines in one of the idlest hours of one of your
idlest days just to tell me a little about you, and whether
Mrs. Commeline is tolerably well. Pray believe me under
all circumstances,</p>

<p>Yours sincerely and affectionately,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>The spring of 1838 was marked by two events of interest
to Miss Barrett and her family. In the first place, Mr.
Barrett's apparently interminable search for a house ended
in his selection of 50 Wimpole Street, which continued to
be his home for the rest of his life, and which is,
consequently, more than any other house in London, to be
associated with his daughter's memory. The second event
was the publication of 'The Seraphim, and other Poems,'
which was Miss Barrett's first serious appearance before the
public, and in her own name, as a poet. The early letters
of this year refer to the preparation of this volume, as well
as to the authoress's health, which was at this time in a very
serious condition, owing to the breaking of a blood-vessel.
Indeed, from this time until her marriage in 1846 she held
her life on the frailest of tenures, and lived in all respects the
life of an invalid.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Monday morning, March 27, 1838 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I do hope that you may not be very
angry, but papa thinks&mdash;and, indeed, I think&mdash;that as I
have already <i>had</i> two proof sheets and forty-eight pages,
and the printers have gone on to the rest of the poem, it
would not be very welcome to them if we were to ask them
to retrace their steps. Besides, I would rather&mdash;<i>I</i> for
myself, <i>I</i>&mdash;that you had the whole poem at once and
clearly printed before you, to insure as many chances as
possible of your liking it. I am <i>promised</i> to see the volume
completed in three weeks from this time, so that the dreadful
moment of your reading it&mdash;I mean the 'Seraphim' part of
it&mdash;cannot be far off, and perhaps, the season being a good
deal advanced even now, you might not, on consideration,
wish me to retard the appearance of the book, except for
some very sufficient reason. I feel very nervous about it&mdash;far
more than I did when my 'Prometheus' crept out [of]
the Greek, or I myself out of the shell, in the first 'Essay
on Mind.' Perhaps this is owing to Dr. Chambers's
medicines, or perhaps to a consciousness that my present
attempt <i>is</i> actually, and will be considered by others, more
a trial of strength than either of my preceding ones.</p>

<p>Thank you for the books, and especially for the <i>editio
rarissima</i>, which I should as soon have thought of your
trusting to me as of your admitting me to stand with gloves
on within a yard of Baxter. This extraordinary confidence
shall not be abused.</p>

<p>I thank you besides for your kind inquiries about my
health. Dr. Chambers did not think me worse yesterday,
notwithstanding the last cold days, which have occasioned
some uncomfortable sensations, and he still thinks I shall
be better in the summer season. In the meantime he has
ordered me to take ice&mdash;out of sympathy with nature, I
suppose; and not to speak a word, out of contradiction to
my particular, human, feminine nature.</p>

<p>Whereupon I revenge myself, you see, by talking all this
nonsense upon paper, and making you the victim.</p>

<p>To propitiate you, let me tell you that your commands
have been performed to the letter, and that one Greek
motto (from 'Orpheus') is given to the first part of 'The
Seraphim,' and another from <i>Chrysostom</i> to the second.</p>

<p>Henrietta desires me to say that she means to go to see
you very soon. Give my very kind remembrance to
Miss Holmes, and believe me,</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Kenyon yesterday. He has a book just
coming out.<a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> I should like you to read it. If you would,
you would thank me for saying so.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyon</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a><br />
[1838.]<br />

<p>Thank you, dearest Mr. Kenyon; and I should (and
<i>shall</i>) thank Miss Thomson too for caring to spend a
thought on me after all the Parisian glories and rationalities
which I sympathise with by many degrees nearer than you
seem to do. We, in this England here, are just social
barbarians, to my mind&mdash;that is, we know how to read and
write and think, and even talk on occasion; but we carry
the old rings in our noses, and are proud of the flowers
pricked into our cuticles. By so much are they better than
we on the Continent, I always think. Life has a thinner
rind, and so a livelier sap. And <i>that</i> I can see in the books
and the traditions, and always understand people who like
living in France and Germany, and should like it myself,
I believe, on some accounts.</p>

<p>Where did you get your Bacchanalian song? Witty,
certainly, but the recollection of the <i>scores</i> a little ghastly
for the occasion, perhaps. You have yourself sung into
silence, too, all possible songs of Bacchus, as the god and I
know.</p>

<p>Here is a delightful letter from Miss Martineau. I cannot
be so selfish as to keep it to myself. The sense of natural
beauty and the <i>good</i> sense of the remarks on rural manners
are both exquisite of their kinds, and Wordsworth is Wordsworth
as she knows him. Have I said that Friday will find
me expecting the kind visit you promise? <i>That</i>, at least,
is what I meant to say with all these words.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
Wimpole Street: Sunday evening [1838?].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Kenyon,&mdash;I am <i>so</i> sorry to hear of your
going, and I not able to say 'good-bye' to you, that&mdash;I
am <i>not</i> writing this note on that account.</p>

<p>It is a begging note, and now I am wondering to myself
whether you will think me very childish or womanish, or
silly enough to be both together (I know your thoughts upon
certain parallel subjects), if I go on to do my begging fully.
I hear that you are going to Mr. Wordsworth's&mdash;to
Rydal Mount&mdash;and I want you to ask <i>for yourself</i>, and then
to send to me in a letter&mdash;by the post, I mean, two
cuttings out of the garden&mdash;of myrtle or geranium; I care
very little which, or what else. Only I say 'myrtle' because
it is less given to die and I say <i>two</i> to be sure of my
chances of saving one. Will you? You would please me
very much by doing it; and certainly not <i>dis</i> please me by
refusing to do it. Your broadest 'no' would not sound
half so strange to me as my 'little crooked thing' does to
you; but you see everybody in the world is fanciful about
something, and why not <i>E.B.B.</i>?</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Kenyon, I have a book of yours&mdash;M. Rio's.
If you want it before you go, just write in two words,
'Send it,' or I shall infer from your silence that I may keep
it until you come back. No necessity for answering this
otherwise. Is it as bad as asking for autographs, or worse?
At any rate, believe me <i>in earnest</i> this time&mdash;besides
being, with every wish for your enjoyment of mountains and
lakes and 'cherry trees,'</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[May 1838.]<br />

<p>My dear friend,&mdash;I am rather better than otherwise
within the last few days, but fear that nothing will make me
essentially so except the invisible sun. I am, however, a little
better, and God's will is always done in mercy.</p>

<p>As to the poems, do forgive me, dear Mr. Boyd; and
refrain from executing your cruel threat of suffering 'the
desire of reading them to pass away.'</p>

<p>I have not one sheet of them; and papa&mdash;and, to say the
truth, I myself&mdash;would so very much prefer your reading the
preface first, that you must try to indulge us in our phantasy.
The book Mr. Bentley half promises to finish the printing
of this week. At any rate it is likely to be all done in the
next: and you may depend upon having a copy <i>as soon</i> as
I have power over one.</p>

<p>With kind regards to Miss Holmes,</p>

<p>Believe me, your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street; Wednesday [May 1838].<br />

<p>Thank you for your inquiry, my dear friend. I had
begun to fancy that between Saunders and Otley and the
'Seraphim' I had fallen to the ground of your disfavour. But
I do trust to be able to send you a copy before next Sunday.</p>

<p>I am thrown back a little just now by having caught a
very bad cold, which has of course affected my cough. The
worst seems, however, to be past, and Dr. Chambers told me
yesterday that he expected to see me in two days nearly as
well as before this casualty. And I have been, thank God,
pretty well lately; and although when the stethoscope was
applied three weeks ago, it did not speak very satisfactorily
of the state of the lungs, yet Dr. Chambers seems to be
hopeful still, and to talk of the wonders which the summer
sunshine (when it does come) may be the means of doing
for me. And people say that I look rather better than
worse, even now.</p>

<p>Did you hear of an autograph of Shakespeare's being
sold lately for a very large sum (I <i>think</i> it was above a
hundred pounds) on the credit of its being the only genuine
autograph extant? Is yours quite safe? And are <i>you</i> so,
in your opinion of its veritableness?</p>

<p>I have just finished a very long barbarous ballad for Miss
Mitford and the Finden's tableaux of this year. The title
is 'The Romaunt of the Page,'<a name="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and the subject not of my
own choosing.</p>

<p>I believe that you will certainly have 'The Seraphim' this
week. Do macadamise the frown from your brow in order
to receive them.</p>

<p>Give my love to Miss Holmes.</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
June 7, 1838 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd,&mdash;Papa is scarcely inclined, nor am I
for myself, to send my book or books to the East Indies.
Let them alone, poor things, until they can walk about a
little! and then it will be time enough for them to 'learn
to <i>fly</i>.'</p>

<p>I am so sorry that Emily Harding saw Arabel and went
away without this note, which I have been meaning to write
to you for several days, and have been so absorbed and
drawn away (all except my thoughts) by other things
necessary to be done, that I was forced to defer it. My
ballad,<a name="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> containing a ladye dressed up like a page and
galloping off to Palestine in a manner that would scandalise
you, went to Miss Mitford this morning. But I augur from
its length that she will not be able to receive it into Finden.</p>

<p>Arabel has told me what Miss Harding told her of your
being in the act of going through my 'Seraphim' for the
second time. For the feeling of interest in me which
brought this labour upon you, I thank you, my dear friend.
What your opinion <i>is</i>, and <i>will</i> be, I am prepared to hear
with a good deal of awe. You will <i>certainly not approve of
the poem</i>.</p>

<p>There now! You see I am prepared. Therefore do
not keep back one rough word, for friendship's sake, but be
as honest as&mdash;you could not help being, without this request.</p>

<p>If I should live, I shall write (<i>I believe</i>) better poems
than 'The Seraphim;' which belief will help me to survive
the condemnation heavy upon your lips.</p>

<p>Affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>'The Seraphim, and other Poems,' a duodecimo of 360
pages, at last made its appearance at the end of May. At
the time of its publication, English poetry was experiencing
one of its periods of ebb between two flood tides of great
achievement. Shelley, Keats, Byron, Scott, Coleridge were
dead; Wordsworth had ceased to produce poetry of the
first order; no fresh inspiration was to be expected from
Landor, Southey, Rogers, Campbell, and such other writers
of the Georgian era as still were numbered with the living.
On the other hand, Tennyson, though already the most
remarkable among the younger poets, was still but exercising
himself in the studies in language and metrical music by
which his consummate art was developed; Browning had
published only 'Pauline,' 'Paracelsus,' and 'Strafford;' the
other poets who have given distinction to the Victorian age
had not begun to write. And between the veterans of the
one generation and the young recruits of the next there was
a singular want of writers of distinction. There was thus
every opportunity for a new poet when Miss Barrett entered
the lists with her first volume of acknowledged verse.</p>

<p>Its reception, on the whole, does credit alike to its own
merits and to the critics who reviewed it. It does not
contain any of those poems which have proved the most
popular among its authoress's complete works, except
'Cowper's Grave;' but 'The Seraphim' was a poem which
deserved to attract attention, and among the minor poems
were 'The Poet's Vow,' 'Isobel's Child,' 'The Romaunt of
Margret,' 'My Doves,' and 'The Sea-mew.' The volume did
not suffice to win any wide reputation for Miss Barrett, and
no second edition was called for; on the other hand, it was
received with more than civility, with genuine cordiality, by
several among the reviewers, though they did not fail to note
its obvious defects. The 'Athenaeum'<a name="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> began its review
with the following declaration:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is an extraordinary volume&mdash;especially welcome as an
evidence of female genius and accomplishment&mdash;but it is hardly less
disappointing than extraordinary. Miss Barrett's genius is of a high
order; active, vigorous, and versatile, but unaccompanied by
discriminating taste. A thousand strange and beautiful views flit
across her mind, but she cannot look on them with steady gaze; her
descriptions, therefore, are often shadowy and indistinct, and her
language wanting in the simplicity of unaffected earnestness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'Examiner,'<a name="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> after quoting at length from the
preface and 'The Seraphim,' continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who will deny to the writer of such verses as these (and they are not
sparingly met with in the volume) the possession of many of the
highest qualities of the divine art? We regret to have some restriction
to add to an admission we make so gladly. Miss Barrett is indeed a
genuine poetess, of no common order; yet is she in danger of being
spoiled by over-ambition; and of realising no greater or more final
reputation than a hectical one, like Crashaw's. She has fancy, feeling,
imagination, expression; but for want of some just equipoise or other,
between the material and spiritual, she aims at flights which have done
no good to the strongest, and therefore falls infinitely short, except in
such detached passages as we have extracted above, of what a proper
exercise of her genius would infallibly reach.... Very various, and
in the main beautiful and true, are the minor poems. But the entire
volume deserves more than ordinary attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'Atlas,'<a name="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> another paper whose literary judgments
were highly esteemed at that date, was somewhat colder,
and dwelt more on the faults of the volume, but added
nevertheless that 'there are occasional passages of great
beauty, and full of deep poetical feeling. In 'The Romaunt
of Margret' it detected the influence of Tennyson&mdash;a suggestion
which Miss Barrett repudiated rather warmly; and it
concluded with the declaration that the authoress 'possesses
a fine poetical temperament, and has given to the public, in
this volume, a work of considerable merit.'</p>

<p>Such were the principal voices among the critical world
when Miss Barrett first ventured into its midst; and she
might well be satisfied with them. Two years later, the
'Quarterly Review'<a name="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> included her name in a review of
'Modern English Poetesses,' along with Caroline Norton,
'V.,' and others whose names are even less remembered
to-day. But though the reviewer speaks of her genius and
learning in high terms of admiration, he cannot be said to
treat her sympathetically. He objects to the dogmatic
positiveness of her prefaces, and protests warmly against her
'reckless repetition of the name of God'&mdash;a charge which,
in another connection, will be found fully and fairly met in
one of her later letters. On points of technique he criticises
her frequent use of the perfect participle with accented final
syllable&mdash;'kissed,' 'bowed,' and the like&mdash;and her fondness
for the adverb 'very;' both of which mannerisms he charges
to the example of Tennyson. He condemns the 'Prometheus,'
though recognising it as 'a remarkable performance for a
young lady.' He criticises the subject of 'The Seraphim,'
'from which Milton would have shrunk;' but adds, 'We give
Miss Barrett, however, the full credit of a lofty purpose, and
admit, moreover, that several particular passages in her
poem are extremely fine; equally profound in thought and
striking in expression.' He sums up as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a word, we consider Miss Barrett to be a woman of undoubted
genius and most unusual learning; but that she has indulged her
inclination for themes of sublime mystery, not certainly without
displaying great power, yet at the expense of that clearness, truth,
and proportion, which are essential to beauty; and has most
unfortunately fallen into the trammels of a school or manner of
writing, which, of all that ever existed&mdash;Lycophron, Lucan, and
Gongora not forgotten&mdash;is most open to the charge of being <i>vitiis
imitabile exemplar</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for the reception of 'The Seraphim' volume by
the outside world. The letters show how it appeared to the
authoress herself.</p>

<p>The first of them deserves a word of special notice,
because it is likewise the first in these volumes addressed to
Miss Mary Russell Mitford, whose name holds a high and
honourable place in the roll of Miss Barrett's friends. Her
own account of the beginning of the friendship should be
quoted in any record of Mrs. Browning's life.</p>

<blockquote><p>'My first acquaintance with Elizabeth Barrett commenced
about fifteen years ago.<a name="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> She was certainly one of
the most interesting persons that I had ever seen. Everybody
who then saw her said the same; so that it is not
merely the impression of my partiality or my enthusiasm.
Of a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls
falling on either side of a most expressive face, large tender
eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, a smile like a sunbeam,
and such a look of youthfulness that I had some difficulty
in persuading a friend, in whose carriage we went together
to Chiswick, that the translatress of the &quot;Prometheus&quot; of
Aeschylus, the authoress of the &quot;Essay on Mind,&quot; was old
enough to be introduced into company, in technical language,
was 'out.' Through the kindness of another invaluable
friend,<a name="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> to whom I owe many obligations, but none so great
as this, I saw much of her during my stay in town. We
met so constantly and so familiarly that, in spite of the
difference of age,<a name="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> intimacy ripened into friendship, and
after my return into the country we corresponded freely and
frequently, her letters being just what letters ought to
be&mdash;her own talk put upon paper.'<a name="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Miss Barrett's letters show how warmly she returned this
feeling of friendship, which lasted until Miss Mitford's
death in 1855. Of the earlier letters many must have disappeared:
for it is evident from Miss Mitford's just quoted
words, and also from many references in her published
correspondence, that they were in constant communication
during these years of Miss Barrett's life in London. After
her marriage, however, the extant letters are far more
frequent, and will be found to fill a considerable place in the
later pages of this work.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Thursday [June 1838].<br />

<p>We thank you gratefully, dearest Miss Mitford. Papa
and I and all of us thank you for your more than kindnesses.
The extracts were both gladdening and surprising&mdash;and the
one the more for being the other also. Oh! it was <i>so</i>
kind of you, in the midst of your multitude of occupations,
to make time (out of love) to send them to us!</p>

<p>As to the ballad, dearest Miss Mitford, which you and
Mr. Kenyon are indulgent enough to like, remember that
he passed his criticism over it&mdash;before it went to you&mdash;and
so if you did not find as many obscurities as he did in it,
the reason is&mdash;<i>his</i> merit and not mine. But don't believe
him&mdash;no!&mdash;don't believe even Mr. Kenyon&mdash;whenever he
says that I am <i>perversely</i> obscure. Unfortunately obscure,
not perversely&mdash;that is quite a wrong word. And the last
time he used it to me (and then, I assure you, another word
still worse was with it) I begged him to confine them for
the future to his jesting moods. Because, <i>indeed</i>, I am not
in the very least degree perverse in this fault of mine, which
is my destiny rather than my choice, and comes upon me,
I think, just where I would eschew it most. So little has
perversity to do with its occurrence, that my fear of it makes
me sometimes feel quite nervous and thought-tied in
composition....</p>

<p>I have not seen Mr. Kenyon since I wrote last. All
last week I was not permitted to get out of bed, and was
haunted with leeches and blisters. And in the course of it,
Lady Dacre was so kind as to call here, and to leave a
note instead of the personal greeting which I was not able
to receive. The honor she did me a year ago, in sending
me her book, encouraged me to offer her my poems. I
hesitated about doing so at first, lest it should appear as if
my vanity were dreaming of a <i>return</i>; but Mr. Kenyon's
opinion turned the balance. I was very sorry not to have
seen Lady Dacre and have written a reply to her note expressive
of this regret. But, after all, this inaudible voice
(except in its cough) could have scarcely made her understand
that I was obliged by her visit, had I been able to
receive it.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambers has freed me again into the drawing-room,
and I am much better or he would not have done so.
There is not, however, much strength or much health, nor
any near prospect of regaining either. It is well that, in
proportion to our feebleness, we may feel our dependence
upon God.</p>

<p>I feel as if I had not said half, and they have come to ask
me if I have not said <i>all</i>! My beloved friend, may you be
happy in all ways!</p>

<p>Do write whenever you wish to talk and have no one to
talk to nearer you than I am! <i>Indeed</i>, I did not forget Dr.
Mitford when I wrote those words, although they look
like it.</p>

<p>Your gratefully affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Wednesday morning [June 1838].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;Do not think me depraved in ingratitude
for not sooner thanking you for the pleasure,
made so much greater by the surprise, which your note of
judgment gave me. The truth is that I have been very
unwell, and delayed answering it immediately until the
painful physical feeling went away to make room for the
pleasurable moral one&mdash;and this I fancied it would do every
hour, so that I might be able to tell you at ease all that was
in my thoughts. The fancy was a vain one. The pain
grew worse and worse, and Dr. Chambers has been here
for two successive days shaking his head as awfully as if it
bore all Jupiter's ambrosial curls; and is to be here again
to-day, but with, I trust, a less grave countenance, inasmuch
as the leeches last night did their duty, and I feel much
better&mdash;God be thanked for the relief. But I am not yet
as well as before this attack, and am still confined to my
bed&mdash;and so you must rather imagine than read what I
thought and felt in reading your wonderful note. Of course
it pleased me very much, very very much&mdash;and, I dare say,
would have made me vain by this time, if it had not been
for the opportune pain and the sight of Dr. Chambers's
face.</p>

<p>I sent a copy of my book to Nelly Bordman <i>before</i> I read
your suggestion. I knew that her kind feeling for me would
interest her in the sight of it.</p>

<p>Thank you once more, dear Mr. Boyd! May all my
critics be gentle after the pattern of your gentleness!</p>

<p>Believe me, affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: June 17 [1838].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I send you a number of the 'Atlas'
which you may keep. It is a favorable criticism, certainly&mdash;but
I confess this of my vanity, that it has not altogether
pleased me. You see what it is to be spoilt.</p>

<p>As to the 'Athenaeum,' although I am <i>not</i> conscious of
the quaintness and mannerism laid to my charge, and am
very sure that I have always written too naturally (that is,
too much from the impulse of thought and feeling) to have
studied '<i>attitudes</i>,' yet the critic was quite right in stating
his opinion, and so am I in being grateful to him for the
liberal praise he has otherwise given me. Upon the whole,
I like his review better than even the 'Examiner,' notwithstanding
my being perfectly satisfied with <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Thank you for the question about my health. I am
very tolerably well&mdash;for <i>me</i>: and am said to look better.
At the same time I am aware of being always on the verge
of an increase of illness&mdash;I mean, in a very excitable state&mdash;with
a pulse that flies off at a word and is only to be
caught by digitalis. But I am better&mdash;for the present&mdash;while
the sun shines.</p>

<p>Thank you besides for your criticisms, which I shall
hold in memory, and use whenever I am not particularly
<i>obstinate</i>, in all my SUCCEEDING EDITIONS!</p>

<p>You will smile at that, and so do <i>I.</i></p>

<p>Arabel is walking in the Zoological Gardens with the
Cliffes&mdash;but I think you will see her before long.</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Don't let me forget to mention the Essays<a name="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>. You shall
have yours&mdash;and Miss Bordman hers&mdash;and the delay has
not arisen from either forgetfulness or indifference on my
part&mdash;although I never deny that I don't like giving the
Essay to anybody because I don't like it. Now that sounds
just like 'a woman's reason,' but it isn't, albeit so reasonable!
I meant to say 'because I don't like the ESSAY.'</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Thursday, June 21 [1838].<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;Notwithstanding this silence so ungrateful
in appearance, I thank you at last, and very sincerely,
for your kind letter. It made me laugh, and amused
me&mdash;and gratified me besides. Certainly your 'quality of
mercy is not strained.'</p>

<p>My reason for not writing more immediately is that
Arabel has meant, day after day, to go to you, and has had
a separate disappointment for every day. She says now,
'<i>Indeed</i>, I hope to see Mr. Boyd to-morrow.' But <i>I</i> say
that I will not keep this answer of mine to run the risk of
another day's contingencies, and that <i>it</i> shall go, whether
<i>she</i> does or not.</p>

<p>I am better a great deal than I was last week, and have
been allowed by Dr. Chambers to come downstairs again,
and occupy my old place on the sofa. My health remains,
however, in what I cannot help considering myself, and in
what, I <i>believe</i>, Dr. Chambers considers, a very precarious
state, and my weakness increases, of course, under the
remedies which successive attacks render necessary. Dr.
Chambers deserves my confidence&mdash;and besides the skill
with which he has met the different modifications of the
complaint, I am grateful to him for a feeling and a
sympathy which are certainly rare in such of his profession
as have their attention diverted, as his must be, by an immense
practice, to fifty objects in a day. But, notwithstanding
all, one breath of the east wind undoes whatever
he labours to do. It is well to look up and remember that in
the eternal reality these second causes are no causes at all.</p>

<p>Don't leave this note about for Arabel to see. I am
anxious not to alarm her, or any one of my family: and it
may please God to make me as well and strong again as ever.
And, indeed, I am twice as well this week as I was last.</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend, dear Mr. Boyd,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>I have seen an extract from a private letter of Mr.
Chorley, editor of the 'Athenaeum,'<a name="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> which speaks <i>huge</i>
praises of my poems. If he were to say a tithe of them in
print, it would be nine times above my expectation!</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[June 1838.]<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I begged your servant to wait&mdash;how
long ago I am afraid to think&mdash;but certainly I must not
make this note very long. I did intend to write to you
to-day in any case. Since Saturday I have had my thanks
ready at the end of my fingers waiting to slide along to the
nib of my pen. Thank you for all your kindness and
criticism, which is kindness too&mdash;thank you at last.
Would that I deserved the praises as well as I do most of
the findings-fault&mdash;and there is no time now to say more of
<i>them</i>. Yet I believe I have something to say, and will find
a time to say it in.</p>


<p>Dr. Chambers has just been here, and does not think
me quite as well as usual. The truth is that I was rather
excited and tired yesterday by rather too much talking and
hearing talking, and suffer for it to-day in my <i>pulse</i>. But
I am better on the whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Cross,<a name="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> the great lion, the insect-making lion, came
yesterday with Mr. Kenyon, and afterwards Lady Dacre.
She is kind and gentle in her manner. She told me that
she had 'placed my book in the hands of Mr. Bobus Smith,
the brother of Sidney Smith, and the best judge in England,'
and that it was to be returned to her on Tuesday. If I
<i>should</i> hear the 'judgment,' I will tell you, whether you care
to hear it or not. There is no other review, as far as I am
aware.</p>

<p>Give my love to Miss Bordman. When is she coming
to see me?</p>

<p>The thunder did not do me any harm.</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend, in great haste, although your
servant is not likely to think so, E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[June 1838.]<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;You must let me <i>feel</i> my thanks to
you, even when I do not <i>say</i> them. I have put up your
various notes together, and perhaps they may do me as
much good hereafter, as they have already, for the most
part, given me pleasure.</p>

<p>The 'burden pure <i>have</i> been' certainly was a misprint,
as certainly 'nor man nor nature satisfy'<a name="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> is ungrammatical.
But I am <i>not</i> so sure about the passage in Isobel:</p>

<p>I am not used to tears at nights
Instead of slumber&mdash;nor to prayer.</p>

<p>Now I think that the passage may imply a repetition of the
words with which it begins, after 'nor'&mdash;thus&mdash;'nor <i>am I used</i>
to prayer,' &amp;c. Either you or I may be right about it, and
either 'or' or 'nor' may be grammatical. At least, so I pray.<a name="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p>You did not answer one question. Do you consider
that '<i>apolyptic</i>' stands without excuse?<a name="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p>I never read Greek to any person except yourself and
Mr. MacSwiney, my brother's tutor. To him I read longer
than a few weeks, but then it was rather guessing and
stammering and tottering through parts of Homer and
extracts from Xenophon than reading. <i>You</i> would not have
called it reading if you had heard it.</p>

<p>I studied hard by myself afterwards, and the kindness
with which afterwards still you assisted me, if yourself
remembers gladly <i>I</i> remember <i>gratefully</i> and gladly.</p>

<p>I have just been told that your servant was desired by
you <i>not to wait a minute</i>.</p>

<p>The wind is unfavorable for the sea. I do not think
there is the least probability of my going before the end of
next week, if then. You shall hear.</p>

<p>Affectionately yours,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>I am tolerably well. I have been forced to take
digitalis again, which makes me feel weak; but still I am
better, I think.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<p>In the course of this year the failure in Miss Barrett's
health had become so great that her doctor advised removal
to a warmer climate for the winter. Torquay was the place
selected, and thither she went in the autumn, accompanied
by her brother Edward, her favourite companion from childhood.
Other members of the family, including Mr. Barrett,
joined them from time to time. At Torquay she was able
to live, but no more, and it was found necessary for her to
stay during the summers as well as the winters of the next
three years. Letters from this period are scarce, though it is
clear from Miss Mitford's correspondence that a continuous
interchange of letters was kept up between the two friends,
and her acquaintanceship with Horne was now ripening
into a close literary intimacy. A story relating to Bishop
Phillpotts of Exeter, the hero of so many racy anecdotes,
is contained in a letter of Miss Barrett's which must have
been written about Christmas of either 1838 or 1839:&mdash;</p>

<p>'He [the bishop] was, however, at church on Christmas
Day, and upon Mr. Elliot's being mercifully inclined to
omit the Athanasian Creed, prompted him most episcopally
from the pew with a &quot;whereas;&quot; and further on in the
Creed, when the benign reader substituted the word <i>condemnation</i>
for the terrible one&mdash;&quot;Damnation!&quot; exclaimed the
bishop. The effect must have been rather startling.'</p>

<p>A slight acquaintance with the words of the Athanasian
Creed will suggest that the story had suffered in accuracy
before it reached Miss Barrett, who, of course, was unable
to attend church, and whose own ignorance on the subject
may be accounted for by remembering that she had been
brought up as a Nonconformist. With a little correction,
however, the story may be added to the many others on
record with respect to 'Henry of Exeter.'</p>

<p>The following letter is shown, by the similarity of its
contents to the one which succeeds it, to belong to November
1839, when Miss Barrett was entering on her second winter
in Torquay.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Beacon Terrace, Torquay: November 24 [1839].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Henrietta <i>shall not</i> write to-day,
whatever she may wish to do. I felt, in reading your
unreproaching letter to her, as self-reproachful as anybody
could with a great deal of innocence (in the way of the
world) to fall back upon. I felt sorry, very sorry, not to
have written something to you something sooner, which was
a possible thing&mdash;although, since the day of my receiving
your welcome letter, I have written scarcely at all, nor that
little without much exertion. Had it been with me as
usual, be sure that you should not have had any silence to
complain of. Henrietta knew I wished to write, and felt, I
suppose, unwilling to take my place when my filling it
myself before long appeared possible. A long story&mdash;and
not as entertaining as Mother Hubbard. But I would rather
tire you than leave you under any wrong impression, where
my regard and thankfulness to you, dearest Mrs. Martin,
are concerned.</p>

<p>To reply to your kind anxiety about me, I may call
myself decidedly better than I have been. Since October I
I have not been out of bed&mdash;except just for an hour a day,
when I am lifted to the sofa with the bare permission of my
physician&mdash;who tells me that it is so much easier to make
me worse than better, that he dares not permit anything like
exposure or further exertion. I like him (Dr. Scully) very
much, and although he evidently thinks my case in the
highest degree precarious, yet knowing how much I bore
last winter and understanding from him that the worst
<i>tubercular</i> symptoms have not actually appeared, I am
willing to think it may be God's will to keep me here still
longer. I would willingly stay, if it were only for the sake
of that tender affection of my beloved family which it so
deeply affects me to consider. Dearest papa is with us
now&mdash;to my great comfort and joy: and looking very
well!&mdash;and astonishing everybody with his eternal youthfulness!
Bro and Henrietta and Arabel besides, I can count as
companions&mdash;and then there is dear Bummy! We are
fixed at Torquay for the winter&mdash;that is, until the end of
May: and after that, if I have any will or power and am
alive to exercise either, I do trust and hope to go away.
The death of my kind friend Dr. Bury was, as you suppose,
a great grief and shock to me. How could it be otherwise,
after his daily kindness to me for a year? And then his
young wife and child&mdash;and the rapidity (a three weeks' illness)
with which he was hurried away from the energies and toils
and honors of professional life to the stillness of <i>that</i> death!</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>'<i>God's Will</i>' is the only answer to the mystery of the
world's afflictions....</p></div>

<p>Don't fancy me worse than I am&mdash;or that this bed-keeping
is the result of a gradual sinking. It is not so. A
feverish attack prostrated me on October 2&mdash;and such will
leave their effects&mdash;and Dr. Scully is so afraid of leading me
into danger by saying, 'You may get up and dress as usual'
that you should not be surprised if (in virtue of being the
senior Torquay physician and correspondingly prudent) he
left me in this durance vile for a great part of the winter. I
am decidedly better than I was a month ago, really and
truly.</p>

<p>May God bless you, dearest Mrs. Martin! My best
and kindest regards to Mr. Martin. Henrietta desires me to
promise for her a letter to Colwall soon; but I think that
one from Colwall should come first. May God bless you!
Bro's fancy just now is painting in water colours and he
performs many sketches. Do you ever in your dreams of

Wednesday, November 27, 1839.<br />

<p>If you can forgive me, my ever dear friend, for a silence
which has not been intended, there will be another reason
for being thankful to you, in addition to the many. To do
myself justice, one of my earliest impulses on seeing my
beloved Arabel, and recurring to the kindness with which
you desired that happiness for me long before I possessed
it, was to write and tell you how happy I felt. But she had
promised, she said, to write herself, and moreover she and
only she was to send you the ballad&mdash;in expectation of your
dread judgment upon which I delayed my own writing. It
came in the first letter we received in our new house, on the
first of last October. An hour after reading it, I was upon
my bed; was attacked by fever in the night, and from that
bed have never even been lifted since&mdash;to these last
days of November&mdash;except for one hour a day to the
sofa at two yards' distance. I am very much better now,
and have been so for some time; but my physician is so
persuaded, he says, that it is easier to do me harm than good,
that he will neither permit any present attempt at further
exertion, nor hint at the time when it may be advisable for
him to permit it. Under the circumstances it has of course
been more difficult than usual for me to write. Pray believe,
my dear and kind friend, in the face of all circumstances and
appearances, that I never forget you, nor am reluctant (oh,
how could that be?) to write to you; and that you shall often
have to pay 'a penny for my thoughts' under the new
Postage Act&mdash;if it be in God's wisdom and mercy to
spare me through the winter. Under the new act I shall
not mind writing ten words and then stopping. As it is,
they would scarcely be worth eleven pennies.</p>

<p>Thank you again and again for your praise of the ballad,
which both delighted and <i>surprised</i> me ... as I had
scarcely hoped that you might like it at all. Think of Mr.
Tilt's never sending me a proof sheet. The consequences
are rather deplorable, and, if they had occurred to you,
might have suggested a deep melancholy for life. In my
case, <i>I</i>, who am, you know, hardened to sins of carelessness,
simply look <i>aghast</i> at the misprints and mispunctuations
coming in as a flood, and sweeping away meanings and
melodies together. The annual itself is more splendid than
usual, and its vignettes have illustrated my story&mdash;angels,
devils and all&mdash;most beautifully. Miss Mitford's tales (in
prose) have suffered besides by reason of Mr. Tilt&mdash;but are
attractive and graphic notwithstanding&mdash;and Mr. Horne has
supplied a dramatic poem of great power and beauty.</p>

<p>How I rejoice with you in the glorious revelation (about
to be) of Gregory's second volume! The 'De Virginitate'
poem will, in its new purple and fine linen, be more
dazzling than ever.</p>

<p>Do you know that George is barrister-at-law of the Inner
Temple&mdash;<i>is</i>? I have seen him gazetted.</p>

<p>My dearest papa is with me now, making me very happy
of course. I have much reason to be happy&mdash;more to be
grateful&mdash;yet am more obedient to the former than to the
latter impulse. May the Giver of good give gratitude with
as full a hand! May He bless <i>you</i>&mdash;and bring us together
again, if no more in the flesh, yet in the spirit!
again, if no more in the flesh, yet in the spirit!</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Torquay: May 29, 1840.<br />

<p>My ever dear Friend,&mdash;It was very pleasant to me to see
your seal upon a letter once more; and although the letter
itself left me with a mournful impression of your having
passed some time so much less happily than I would wish
and pray for you, yet there remains the pleasant thought to
me still that you have not altogether forgotten me. Do
receive the expression of my most affectionate sympathy
under this and every circumstance&mdash;and I fear that the shock
to your nerves and spirits could not be a light one, however
impressed you might be and must be with the surety and
verity of God's love working in all His will. Poor poor
Patience! Coming to be so happy with you, with that
joyous smile I thought so pretty! Do you not remember
my telling you so? Well&mdash;it is well and better for her;
happier for her, if God in Christ Jesus have received her,
than her hopes were of the holiday time with you. The
holiday is <i>for ever</i> now....</p>

<p>I heard from Nelly Bordman only a few days before
receiving your letter, and so far from preparing me for all
this sadness and gloom, she pleased me with her account of
you whom she had lately seen&mdash;dwelling upon your
retrograde passage into youth, and the delight you were
taking in the presence and society of some still more youthful,
fair, and gay <i>monstrum amandum</i>, some prodigy of intellectual
accomplishment, some little Circe who never turned
anybodies into pigs. I learnt too from her for the first time
that you were settled at Hampstead! Whereabout at
Hampstead, and for how long? She didn't tell me <i>that</i>,
thinking of course that I knew something more about you
than I do. Yes indeed; you <i>do</i> treat me very shabbily.
I agree with you in thinking so. To think that so many
hills and woods should interpose between us&mdash;that I should
be lying here, fast bound by a spell, a sleeping beauty in a
forest, and that <i>you</i>, who used to be such a doughty knight,
should not take the trouble of cutting through even a hazel
tree with your good sword, to find out what had become of
me. Now do tell me, the hazel tree being down at last,
whether you mean to live at Hampstead, whether you have
taken a house there and have carried your books there, and
wear Hampstead grasshoppers in your bonnet (as they did
at Athens) to prove yourself of the soil.</p>

<p>All this nonsense will make you think I am better, and
indeed I am pretty well just now&mdash;quite, however, confined
to the bed&mdash;except when lifted from it to the sofa baby-wise
while they make it; even then apt to faint. Bad symptoms
too do not leave me; and I am obliged to be blistered every
few days&mdash;but I am free from any attack just now, and am
a good deal less feverish than I am occasionally. There
has been a consultation between an Exeter physician and
my own, and they agree exactly, both hoping that with care
I shall pass the winter, and rally in the spring, both hoping
that I may be able to go about again with some comfort and
independence, although I never can be fit again for anything
like exertion....</p>

<p>Do you know, did you ever hear anything of Mr. Horne
who wrote 'Cosmo de Medici,' and the 'Death of Marlowe,'
and is now desecrating his powers (I beg your pardon) by
writing the life of Napoleon? By the way, he is the author
of a dramatic sketch in the last Finden.</p>

<p>He is in my mind one of the very first poets of the day,
and has written to me so kindly (offering, although I never
saw him in my life, to cater for me in literature, and send
me down anything likely to interest me in the periodicals),
that I cannot but think his amiability and genius do honor
to one another.</p>
<br />

<p>Do you remember Mr. Caldicott who used to preach in
the infant schoolroom at Sidmouth? He died here the
death of a saint, as he had lived a saintly life, about three
weeks ago. It affected me a good deal. But he was always
so associated in my thoughts more with heaven than earth,
that scarcely a transition seems to have passed upon his
locality. 'Present with the Lord' is true of him now; even
as 'having his conversation in heaven' was formerly.
There is little difference.</p>

<p>May it be so with us all, with you and with me, my ever
and very dear friend! In the meantime do not forget me.</p>

<p>I never can forget <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Arabel desires her love to be offered to you.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
1 Beacon Terrace, Torquay: July 8, 1840.<br />

<p>My ever dear Friend,&mdash;I must write to you, although it
is so very long, or at least seems so, since you wrote to me.
But you say to Arabel in speaking of me that I '<i>used</i> to
care for what is poetical;' therefore, perhaps you say to
yourself sometimes that I <i>used</i> to care for <i>you</i>! I am
anxious to vindicate my identity to you, in that respect
above all.</p>

<p>It is a long, dreary time since I wrote to you. I admit
the pause on my own part, while I charge you with another.
But <i>your</i> silence has embraced more pleasantness and less
suffering to you than mine has to me, and I thank God for
a prosperity in which my unchangeable regard for you
causes me to share directly....</p>

<p>I have not rallied this summer as soon and well as I
did last. I was very ill early in April at the time of our
becoming conscious to our great affliction&mdash;so ill as to
believe it utterly improbable, speaking humanly, that I
ever should be any better. I am, however, a very great
deal better, and gain strength by sensible degrees, however
slowly, and do hope for the best&mdash;'the best' meaning one
sight more of London. In the meantime I have not yet
been able to leave my bed.</p>

<p>To prove to you that I who 'used to care' for poetry do
so still, and that I have not been absolutely idle lately, an
'Athenaeum' shall be sent to you containing a poem on
the subject of the removal of Napoleon's ashes.<a name="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> It is a
fitter subject for you than for me. Napoleon is no idol of
<i>mine. I</i> never made a 'setting sun' of him. But my
physician suggested the subject as a noble one and then
there was something suggestive in the consideration that
the 'Bellerophon' lay on those very bay-waters opposite to
my bed.</p>

<p>Another poem (which you won't like, I dare say) is
called 'The Lay of the Rose,'<a name="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and appeared lately in a
magazine. Arabel is going to write it out for you, she
desires me to tell you with her best love. Indeed, I have
written lately (as far as manuscript goes) a good deal, only
on all sorts of subjects and in as many shapes.</p>

<p>Lazarus would make a fine poem, wouldn't he? I lie
here, weaving a great many schemes. I am seldom at a
loss for thread.</p>

<p>Do write sometimes to me, and tell me if you do anything
besides hearing the clocks strike and bells ring. My
beloved papa is with me still. There are so many mercies
close around me (and his presence is far from the least),
that God's <i>Being</i> seems proved to me, <i>demonstrated</i> to me,
by His manifested love. May His blessing in the full
lovingness rest upon you always! Never fancy I can forget
or think of you coldly.</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>The above letter was written only three days before the
tragedy which utterly wrecked Elizabeth Barrett's life for a
time, and cast a deep shadow over it which never wholly
passed away&mdash;the death of her brother Edward through
drowning. On July 11, he and two friends had gone for a
sail in a small boat. They did not return when they were
expected, and presently a rumour came that a boat, answering
in appearance to theirs, had been seen to founder in
Babbicombe Bay; but it was not until three days later that
final confirmation of the disaster was obtained by the
discovery of the bodies. What this blow meant to the
bereaved sister cannot be told: the horror with which she
refers to it, even at a distance of many years, shows how
deeply it struck. It was the loss of the brother whom she
loved best of all; and she had the misery of thinking that
it was to attend on her that he had come to the place
where he met his death. Little wonder if Torquay was
thenceforward a memory from which she shrank, and if
even the sound of the sea became a horror to her.</p>

<p>One natural consequence of this terrible sorrow is
a long break in her correspondence. It is not until
the beginning of 1841 that she seems to have resumed
the thread of her life and to have returned to
her literary occupations. Her health had inevitably
suffered under the shock, and in the autumn of 1840
Miss Mitford speaks of not daring to expect more than
a few months of lingering life. But when things were
at the worst, she began unexpectedly to take a turn
for the better. Through the winter she slowly gathered
strength, and with strength the desire to escape from
Torquay, with its dreadful associations, and to return
to London. Meanwhile her correspondence with her
friends revived, and with Horne in particular she was
engaged during 1841 in an active interchange of views with
regard to two literary projects. Indeed, it was only the
return to work that enabled her to struggle against the
numbing effect of the calamity which had overwhelmed her.
Some time afterwards (in October 1843) she wrote to
Mrs. Martin: 'For my own part and experience&mdash;I do not
say it as a phrase or in exaggeration, but from very clear and
positive conviction&mdash;I do believe that I should be <i>mad</i> at
this moment, if I had not forced back&mdash;dammed out&mdash;the
current of rushing recollections by work, work, work.'
One of the projects in which she was concerned was
'Chaucer Modernised,' a scheme for reviving interest in the
father of English poetry, suggested in the first instance by
Wordsworth, but committed to the care of Horne, as editor,
for execution. According to the scheme as originally
planned, all the principal poets of the day were to be
invited to share the task of transmuting Chaucer into
modern language. Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt, Horne, and
others actually executed some portions of the work;
Tennyson and Browning, it was hoped, would lend a hand
with some of the later parts. Horne invited Miss Barrett
to contribute, and, besides executing modernisations of
'Queen Annelida and False Arcite' and 'The Complaint of
Annelida,'<a name="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> she also advised generally on the work of the
other writers during its progress through the press. The
other literary project was for a lyrical drama, to be written
in collaboration with Horne. It was to be called 'Psych&eacute;
Apocalypt&eacute;,' and was to be a drama on the Greek model,
treating of the birth and self-realisation of the soul of man.</p>

<p>The sketch of its contents, given in the correspondence
with Horne, will make the modern reader accept with
equanimity the fact that it never progressed beyond the
initial stage of drafting the plot. It is allegorical,
philosophical, fantastic, unreal&mdash;everything which was
calculated to bring out the worst characteristics of Miss
Barrett's style and to intensify her faults. Fortunately her
removal from Torquay to London interrupted the execution
of the scheme. It was never seriously taken up again, and,
though never explicitly abandoned, died a natural death
from inanition, somewhat to the relief of Miss Barrett, who
had come to recognise its impracticability.</p>

<p>Apart from the correspondence with Horne, which has
been published elsewhere, very few letters are left from this
period; but those which here follow serve to bridge over the
interval until the departure from Torquay, which closes one
well-marked period in the life of the poetess.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
December 11, 1840.<br />

<p>My ever dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I should have written to
you without this last proof of your remembrance&mdash;this
cape, which, warm and pretty as it is, I value so much more
as the work of your hands and gift of your affection towards
me. Thank you, dearest Mrs. Martin, and thank you too
for <i>all the rest</i>&mdash;for all your sympathy and love. And do
believe that although grief had so changed me from myself
and warped me from my old instincts, as to prevent my looking
forwards with pleasure to seeing you again, yet that full
amends are made in the looking back with a pleasure more
true because more tender than any old retrospections. Do
give my love to dear Mr. Martin, and say what I could not
have said even if I had seen him.</p>

<p>Shall you really, dearest Mrs. Martin, come again?
Don't think we do not think of the hope you left us.
Because we do indeed.</p>

<p>A note from papa has brought the comforting news that
my dear, dear Stormie is in England again, in London, and
looking perfectly well. It is a mercy which makes me very
thankful, and would make me joyful if anything could.
But the meanings of some words change as we live on.
Papa's note is hurried. It was a sixty-day passage, and that
is all he tells me. Yes&mdash;there is something besides about
Sette and Occy being either unknown or misknown, through
the fault of their growing. Papa is not near returning, I
think. He has so much to do and see, and so much cause
to be enlivened and renewed as to spirits, that I begged him
not to think about me and stay away as long as he pleased.
And the accounts of him and of all at home are satisfying,
I thank God....</p>

<p>There is an east wind just now, which I feel. Nevertheless,
Dr. Scully has said, a few minutes since, that I am
as well as he could hope, considering the season.</p>

<p>May God bless you ever!</p>

<p>Your gratefully attached<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
March 29, 1841.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Have you thought 'The
dream has come true'? I mean the dream of the flowers
which you pulled for me and I wouldn't look at, even? I
fear you must have thought that the dream about my ingratitude
has come true.</p>

<p>And yet it has not. Dearest Mrs. Martin, it has <i>not</i>.
I have not forgotten you or remembered you less affectionately
through all the silence, or longed less for the
letters I did not ask for. But the truth is, my faculties
seem to hang heavily now, like flappers when the spring is
broken. <i>My</i> spring <i>is</i> broken, and a separate exertion
is necessary for the lifting up of each&mdash;and then it falls
down again. I never felt so before: there is no wonder
that I should feel so now. Nevertheless, I don't give up
much to the pernicious languor&mdash;the tendency to lie
down to sleep among the snows of a weary journey&mdash;I
don't give up much to it. Only I find it sometimes at the
root of certain negligences&mdash;for instance, of this toward

<i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin, receive my sympathy, <i>our</i> sympathy,
in the anxiety you have lately felt so painfully, and in the
rejoicing for its happy issue. Do say when you write (I
take for granted, you see, that you will write) how Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; is now&mdash;besides the intelligence more nearly touching me,
of your own and Mr. Martin's health and spirits. May God
bless you both!</p>

<p>Ah! but you did not come: I was disappointed!</p>

<p>And Mrs. Hanford! Do you know, I tremble in my
reveries sometimes, lest you should think it, guess it to
be half unkind in me not to have made an exertion to see
Mrs. Hanford. It was not from want of interest in her&mdash;least
of all from want of love to <i>you</i>. But I have not
stirred from my bed yet. But, to be honest, that was
not the reason&mdash;I did not feel as if I <i>could</i>, without a
painful effort, which, on the other hand, could not, I was
conscious, result in the slightest shade of satisfaction to her,
receive and talk to her. Perhaps it is hard for you to <i>fancy</i>
even how I shrink away from the very thought of seeing a
human face&mdash;except those immediately belonging to me
in love or relationship&mdash;(yours <i>does</i>, you know)&mdash;and a
stranger's might be easier to look at than one long
known....</p>

<p>For my own part, my dearest Mrs. Martin, my heart has
been lightened lately by kind, <i>honest</i> Dr. Scully (who would
never give an opinion just to please me), saying that I am
'quite right' to mean to go to London, and shall probably
be fit for the journey early in June. He says that I may
pass the winter there moreover, and with impunity&mdash;that
wherever I am it will probably be necessary for me to remain
shut up during the cold weather, and that under such
circumstances it is quite possible to warm a London room to
as safe a condition as a room <i>here</i>. So my heart is lightened
of the fear of opposition: and the only means of regaining
whatever portion of earthly happiness is not irremediably
lost to me by the Divine decree, I am free to use. In the
meantime, it really does seem to me that I make some progress
in health&mdash;if the word in my lips be not a mockery.
Oh, I fancy I shall be strengthened to get home!</p>

<p>Your remarks on Chaucer pleased me very much. I am
glad you liked what I did&mdash;or tried to do&mdash;and as to the
criticisms, you were right&mdash;and they sha'n't be unattended
to if the opportunity of correction be given to me.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
August 28, 1841.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I have fluctuated from one
shadow of uncertainty and anxiety to another, all the summer,
on the subject to which my last earthly wishes cling, and I
delayed writing to you to be able to say I am going to
London. I may say so now&mdash;as far as the human may say
'yes' or 'no' of their futurity. The carriage, a patent
carriage with a bed in it, and set upon some hundreds of
springs, is, I believe, on its road down to me, and immediately
upon its arrival we begin our journey. Whether we
shall ever complete it remains uncertain&mdash;<i>more</i> so than
other uncertainties. My physician appears a good deal
alarmed, calls it an undertaking full of hazard, and myself
the 'Empress Catherine' for insisting upon attempting it.
But I must. I go, as 'the doves to their windows,' to the
only earthly daylight I see here. I go to rescue myself from
the associations of this dreadful place. I go to restore to
my poor papa the companionships family. Enough
has been done and suffered for <i>me</i>. I thank God I am
going home at last.</p>

<p>How kind it was in you, my very kind and ever very dear
friend, to ask me to visit you at Hampstead! I felt myself
smiling while I read that part of your letter, and laid it down
and suffered the vision to arise of your little room and your
great Gregory and your dear self scolding me softly as in the
happy olden times for not reading slow enough. Well&mdash;we
do not know what <i>may</i> happen! I <i>may</i> (even that is
probable) read to you again. But now&mdash;ah, my dear friend&mdash;if
you could imagine me such as I am!&mdash;you would not
think I could visit you! Yet I am wonderfully better this
summer; and if I can but reach home and bear the first
painful excitement, it will do me more good than anything&mdash;I
know it will! And if it does not, it will be <i>well</i> even
so.</p>

<p>I shall tell them to send you the 'Athenaeum' of last
week, where I have a 'House of Clouds,'<a name="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> which papa
likes so much that he would wish to live in it if it were not
for the damp. There is not a clock in one room&mdash;that's
another objection. How are your clocks? Do they go?
and do you like their voices as well as you used to do?</p>

<p>I think Annie is not with you; but in case of her still
being so, do give her (and yourself too) Arabel's love and
mine. I wish I heard of you oftener. Is there nobody to
write? May God bless you!</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
August 31, 1831 [<i>sic</i>].<br />

<p>Thank you, my ever dear friend, with almost my last
breath at Torquay, for your kindness about the Gregory,
besides the kind note itself. It is, however, too late. We
go, or mean at present to go, to-morrow; and the carriage
which is to waft us through the air upon a thousand springs
has actually arrived. You are not to think severely upon
Dr. Scully's candour with me as to the danger of the
journey. He <i>does</i> think it 'likely to do me harm;' therefore,
you know, he was justified by his medical responsibility in
laying before me all possible consequences. I have considered
them all, and dare them gladly and gratefully.
Papa's domestic comfort is broken up by the separation in
his family, and the associations of this place lie upon me,
struggle as I may, like the oppression of a perpetual night-mare.
It is an instinct of self-preservation which impels me
to escape&mdash;or to try to escape. And In God's mercy&mdash;though
God forbid that I should deny either His mercy or
His justice, if He should deny me&mdash;we may be together in
Wimpole Street in a few days. Nelly Bordman has kindly
written to me Mr. Jago's favourable opinion of the patent
carriages, and his conviction of my accomplishing the
journey without inconvenience.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear dear friend! Give my love
to dearest Annie! Perhaps, if I am ever really in Wimpole
Street, <i>safe enough for Greek</i>, you will trust the poems to
me which you mention. I care as much for poetry as ever,
and could not more.</p>

<p>In September 1841 the journey from Torquay was actually
achieved, and Miss Barrett returned to her father's house
in London, from which she was never to be absent for
more than a few hours at a time until the day, five years
later, when she finally left it to join her husband, Robert
Browning. Her life was that of an invalid, confined to
her room for the greater part of each year, and unable to
see any but a few intimate friends. Still, she regained some
sort of strength, especially during the warmth of the summer
months, and was able to throw herself with real interest into
literary work. In a life such as this there are few outward
events to record, and its story is best told in Miss Barrett's
own letters, which, for the most part, need little comment.
The letters of the end of 1841 and beginning of 1842 are
almost entirely written to Mr. Boyd, and the main subject
of them is the series of papers on the Greek Christian poets
and the English poets which, at the suggestion of Mr. Dilke,
then editor of the 'Athenaeum,' she contributed to that
periodical. Of the composition of original poetry we hear
less at this time.</p>

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I thank you for the letter and
books which crossed the threshold of this house before me,
and looked like your welcome to me home. I have read the
passages you wished me to read&mdash;I have read them <i>again</i>:
for I remember reading them under your star (or the
greater part of them) a long while ago. You, on the other
hand, may remember of <i>me</i>, that I never could concede to
you much admiration for your Gregory as a poet&mdash;not even
to his grand work 'De Virginitate.' He is one of those
writers, of whom there are instances in our own times, who
are only poetical in prose.</p>

<p>The passage imitative of Chryses I cannot think much
of. Try to be forgiving. It is toasted dry between the two
fires of the Scriptures and Homer, and is as stiff as any dry
toast out of the simile. To be sincere, I like dry toast better.</p>

<p>The Hymns and Prayers I very much prefer; and
although I remembered a good deal about them, it has
given me a pleasure you will approve of to go through them
in this edition. The one which I like best, which I like far
best, which I think worth all the rest ('De Virginitate' and
all put together), is the <i>second</i> upon page 292, beginning
'Soi charis.' It is very fine, I think, written out of the
heart and for the heart, warm with a natural heat, and not
toasted dry and brown and stiff at a fire by any means.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Boyd, I coveted Arabel's walk to you the
other day. I shall often covet my neighbour's walks, I
believe, although (and may God be praised for it!) I am
more happy&mdash;that is, nearing to the feeling of happiness
now&mdash;than a month since I could believe possible to a heart
so bruised and crushed as mine has [been] be at
home is a blessing and a relief beyond what these words
can say.</p>

<p>But, dear Mr. Boyd, you said something in a note
to Arabel some little time ago, which I will ask of your
kindness to avoid saying again. I have been through the
whole summer very much better; and even if it were not so
I should dread being annoyed by more medical speculations.
Pray do not suggest any. I am not in a state to admit of
experiments, and my case is a very clear and simple one. I
have not <i>one symptom</i> like those of my old illness; and after
more than fifteen years' absolute suspension of them, their
recurrence is scarcely probable. My case is very clear: not
tubercular consumption, not what is called a 'decline,' but
an affection of the lungs which leans towards it. You know
a blood-vessel broke three years ago, and I never quite got
over it. Mr. Jago, not having seen me, could scarcely be
justified in a conjecture of the sort, when the opinions of
four able physicians, two of them particularly experienced in
diseases of the chest, and the other two the most eminent
of the faculty in the east and west of England, were decided
and contrary, while coincident with each other. Besides, you
see, I am becoming better&mdash;and I could not desire more than
that. Dear Mr. Boyd, do not write a word about it any
more, either to me or others. I am sure you would not
willingly disturb me. Nelly Bordman is good and dear,
but I can't let her prescribe for me anything except her own
affection.</p>

<p>I hope Arabel expressed for me my thankful sense of
Mrs. Smith's kind intention. But, indeed, although I
would see <i>you</i>, dear Mr. Boyd, gladly, or an angel or a
fairy or any very particular friend, I am not fit either in body
or spirit for general society. I <i>can't</i> see people, and if I
could it would be very bad for me. Is Mrs. Smith writing?
Are you writing? Part of me is worn out; but the poetical
part&mdash;that is, the <i>love</i> of poetry&mdash;is growing in me as freshly
and strongly as if it were watered every day. Did anybody
ever love it and stop in the middle? I wonder if anybody
ever did?...</p>

<p>Believe me your affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I should not have been half as idle
about transcribing these translations<a name="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> if I had fancied you
could care so much to have them as Arabel tells me you
do. They are recommended to your mercy, O Greek
Daniel! The <i>last</i> sounds in my ears most like English
poetry; but I assure you I took the least pains with it.
The second is obscure as its original, if it do not (as it does
not) equal it otherwise. The first is yet more unequal to
the Greek. I praised that Greek poem above all of
Gregory's, for the reason that it has <i>unity and completeness</i>,
for which, to speak generally, you may search the streets
and squares and alleys of Nazianzum in vain. Tell me
what you think of my part.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Have you a Plotinus, and would you trust him to me in
that case? Oh no, you do not tempt me with your musical
clocks. My time goes to the best music when I read or
write; and whatever money I can spend upon my own
pleasures flows away in books.</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a><br />
50 Wimpole Street: January 2, 1842.<br />

<p>Miss Barrett, inferring Mr. Westwood from the handwriting,
begs his acceptance of the unworthy little book<a name="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> he
does her the honour of desiring to see.</p>

<p>It is more unworthy than he could have expected when
he expressed that desire, having been written in very early
youth, when the mind was scarcely free in any measure
from trammels and Popes, and, what is worse, when
flippancy of language was too apt to accompany immaturity
of opinion. The miscellaneous verses are, still more than
the chief poem, 'childish things' in a strict literal sense,
and the whole volume is of little interest even to its writer
except for personal reasons&mdash;except for the traces of dear
affections, since rudely wounded, and of that <i>love</i> of poetry
which began with her sooner than so soon, and must last
as long as life does, without being subject to the changes of
life. Little more, therefore, can remain for such a volume
than to be humble and shrink from circulation. Yet
Mr. Westwood's kind words win it to his hands. Will he
receive at the same moment the expression of touched and
gratified feelings with which Miss Barrett read what he
wrote on the subject of her later volumes, still very
imperfect, although more mature and true to the <i>truth</i>
within? Indeed she is thankful for what he said so kindly
in his note to her.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: January 6, 1842.<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;I have done your bidding and sent
the translations to the 'Athenaeum,' attaching to them an
infamous prefatory note which says all sorts of harm of
Gregory's poetry. You will be very angry with it and me.</p>

<p>And you <i>may</i> be angry for another reason&mdash;that in the
midst of my true thankfulness for the emendations you
sent me, I ventured to reject one or two of them. You
are right, probably, and I wrong; but still, I thought within
myself with a womanly obstinacy not altogether peculiar
to me,&mdash;'If he and I were to talk together about them,
he would kindly give up the point to me&mdash;so that, now
we cannot talk together, <i>I might as well take it</i>.' Well,
you will see what I have done. Try not to be angry with
me. You shall have the 'Athenaeum' as soon as possible.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Boyd, you know how I disbelieved the
probability of these papers being accepted. You will comprehend
my surprise on receiving last night a very courteous:
note from the editor, which I would send to you if it were
legible to anybody except people used to learn reading
from the pyramids. He wishes me to contribute to the
'Athenaeum' some prose papers in the form of reviews&mdash;'the
review being a mere form, and the book a mere text.' He is
not very clear&mdash;but I fancy that a few translations of
<i>excerpta</i>, with a prose analysis and synthesis of the
original author's genius, might suit his purpose. Now suppose
I took up some of the early Christian Greek poets, and wrote
a few continuous papers <i>so</i>?<a name="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Give me your advice, my dear
friend! I think of Synesius, for one. Suppose you send me a list
of the names which occur to you! <i>Will</i> you advise me? Will
you write directly? Will you make allowance for my
teazing you? Will you lend me your little Synesius, and
Clarke's book? I mean the one commenced by Dr.
Clarke and continued by his son. Above all things, however,
I want the advice.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Wednesday, January 13, 1842 (postmark).<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;Thank you, thank you, for your kind
suggestion and advice altogether. I had just (when your
note arrived) finished two hymns of Synesius, one being
the seventh and the other the ninth. Oh! I do remember
that you performed upon the latter, and my modesty should
have certainly bid me 'avaunt' from it. Nevertheless, it is so
fine, so prominent in the first class of Synesius's beauties,
that I took courage and dismissed my scruples, and have
produced a version which I have not compared to yours at
all hitherto, but which probably is much rougher and <i>rather</i>
closer, winning in faith what it loses in elegance. 'Elegance'
isn't a word for me, you know, generally speaking. The
barbarians herd with me, 'by two and three.'</p>

<p>I had a letter to-day from Mr. Dilke, who agrees to everything,
closes with the idea about 'Christian Greek poets'
(only begging me to keep away from theology), and
suggesting a subsequent reviewal of English poetical
literature, from Chaucer down to our times.<a name="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Well, but the
Greek poets. With all your kindness, I have scarcely
sufficient materials for a full and minute survey of them. I
have won a sight of the 'Poetae Christiani,' but the price is
ruinous&mdash;<i>fourteen guineas</i>, and then the work consists
almost entirely of Latin poets, deducting Gregory and
Nonnus, and John Damascenus, and a cento from Homer
by somebody or other. Turning the leaves rapidly, I do
not see much else; and you know I may get a separate
copy of John Dam., and have access to the rest. Try
to turn in your head what I should do. Greg. Nyssen
did not write poems, did he? Have I a chance of
seeing your copy of Mr. Clarke's book? It would be
useful in the matters of chronology.</p>

<p>I humbly beg your pardon, and Gregory's, for the
insolence of my note. It was as brief as it could be, and
did not admit of any extended reference and admiration
to his qualities as an orator. But whoever read it to you
should have explained that when I wrote 'He was an
orator,' the word <i>orator</i> was marked emphatically, so as to
appear printed in capital letters of emphasis. Do not say
'you <i>chose</i>,' 'you <i>chose</i>.' I didn't and don't choose to be
obstinate, indeed; but I can't see the sense of that 'heavenly
soul.'</p>

<p>Ever your grateful and affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>I shall have room for praising Gregory in these
papers.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
February 4, 1842.<br />

<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;You must be thinking, if you are not
a St. Boyd for good temper, that among the Gregorys and
Synesiuses I have forgotten everything about you. No;
indeed it has not been so. I have never <i>stopped</i> being
grateful to you for your kind notes, and the two last pieces
of Gregory, although I did not say an overt 'Thank you;'
but I have been very very busy besides, and thus I answered
to myself for your being kind enough to pardon a silence
which was compelled rather than voluntary.</p>

<p>Do you ever observe that as vexations don't come alone,
occupations don't, and that, if you happen to be engaged
upon one particular thing, it is the signal for your being
waylaid by bundles of letters desiring immediate answers,
and proof sheets or manuscript works whose writers request
your opinion while their 'printer waits'? The old saints
are not responsible for all the filling up of my time. I have
been <i>busy upon busy</i>.</p>

<p>The first part of my story about the Greek poets went
to the 'Athenaeum' some days ago, but, although graciously
received by the editor, it won't appear this week, or I should
have had a proof sheet (which was promised to me) before
now. I must contrive to include all I have to say on the
subject in <i>three parts</i>. They will admit, they tell me, a
fourth <i>if I please</i>, but evidently they would prefer as much
brevity as I could vouchsafe. Only two poets are in the
first notice, and <i>twenty</i> remain&mdash;and neither of the two is
Gregory.</p>

<p>Will you let me see that volume of Gregory which contains
the 'Christus Patiens'? Send it by any boy on the
heath, and I will remunerate him for the walk and the
burden, and thank you besides. Oh, don't be afraid! I
am not going to charge it upon Gregory, but on the younger
Apollinaris, whose claim is stronger, and I rather wish to
refresh my recollection of the height and breadth of that
tragic misdemeanour.</p>

<p>It is quite true that I never have suffered much pain,
and equally so that I continue most decidedly better,
notwithstanding the winter. I feel, too&mdash;I do hope not
ungratefully&mdash;the blessing granted to me in the possibility
of literary occupation,&mdash;which is at once occupation and
distraction. Carlyle (not the infidel, but the philosopher)
calls literature a 'fireproof pleasure.' How truly! How
deeply I have felt that truth!</p>

<p>May God bless you, dear Mr. Boyd. I don't despair of
looking in your face one day yet before my last.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate and obliged<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>Arabel's love.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
March 2, 1842.<br />

<p>My ever very dear Friend,&mdash;Do receive the assurance
that whether I leave out the right word or put in the wrong
one, you never can be other to me than just <i>that</i> while I
live, and why not after I have ceased to live? And now&mdash;what
have I done in the meantime, to be called 'Miss
Barrett'? 'I pause for a reply.'</p>

<p>Of course it gives me very great pleasure to hear you
speak so kindly of my first paper. Some <i>bona avis</i> as
good as a nightingale must have shaken its wings over me
as I began it; and if it will but sit on the same spray
while I go on towards the end, I shall rejoice exactly four-fold.
The third paper went to Mr. Dilke to-day, and I was
so fidgety about getting it away (and it seemed to cling to
my writing case with both its hands), that I would not do
any writing, even as little as this note, until it was quite
gone out of sight. You know it is possible that he, the
editor, may not please to have the <i>fourth</i> paper; but even
in that case, it is better for the 'Remarks' to remain fragmentary,
than be compressed till they are as dry as a <i>hortus
siccus</i> of poets.</p>

<p>Certainly you do and must praise my number one too
much. Number one (that's myself) thinks so. I do really;
and the supererogatory virtue of kindness may be acknowledged
out of the pale of the Romish Church.</p>

<p>In regard to Gregory and Synesius, you will see presently
that I have not wronged them altogether.</p>

<p>As you have ordered the 'Athenaeums,' I will not send
one to-morrow so as to repeat my ill fortune of being too
late. But tell me if you would like to have any from me,
and how many.</p>

<p>It was very kind in you to pat Flush's<a name="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> head in defiance
of danger and from pure regard for me. I kissed his head
where you had patted it; which association of approximations
I consider as an imitation of shaking hands with you
and as the next best thing to it. You understand&mdash;don't
you?&mdash;that Flush is my constant companion, my friend, my
amusement, lying with his head on one page of my folios
while I read the other. (Not <i>your</i> folios&mdash;I respect <i>your</i>
books, be sure.) Oh, I dare say, if the truth were known,
Flush understands Greek excellently well.</p>

<p>I hope you are right in thinking that we shall meet
again. Once I wished <i>not</i> to live, but the faculty of life
seems to have sprung up in me again, from under the
crushing foot of heavy grief.</p>

<p>Be it all as God wills.</p>

<p>Believe me, your ever affectionate</p>

<p>E.B.B.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Saturday night, March 5, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I am quite angry with myself for
forgetting your questions when I answered your letter.</p>

<p>Could you really imagine that I have not looked into the
Greek tragedians for years, with my true love for Greek
poetry? That is asking a question, you will say, and not
answering it. Well, then, I answer by a 'Yes' the one you
put to me. I had two volumes of Euripides with me in
Devonshire, and have read him as well as Aeschylus and
Sophocles&mdash;that is <i>from</i> them&mdash;both before and since I
went there. You know I have gone through every line of
the three tragedians long ago, in the way of regular, consecutive
reading.</p>

<p>You know also that I had at different times read different
dialogues of Plato; but when three years ago, and a few
months previous to my leaving home, I became possessed
of a complete edition of his works, edited by Bekker, why
then I began with the first volume and went through the
whole of his writings, both those I knew and those I did not
know, one after another: and have at this time read, not
only all that is properly attributed to Plato, but even those
dialogues and epistles which pass falsely under his name&mdash;everything
except two books I think, or three, of the treatise
'De Legibus,' which I shall finish in a week or two, as soon
as I can take breath from Mr. Dilke.</p>

<p>Now the questions are answered.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate and grateful friend,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Thursday, March 10, 1842 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I did not know until to-day
whether the paper would appear on Saturday or not; but as
I have now received the proof sheets, there can be no doubt
of it. I have been and <i>am</i> hurried and hunted almost into
a corner through the pressing for the fourth paper, and the
difficulty about books. You will forgive a very short note
to night.</p>

<p>I have read of Aristotle only his Poetics, his Ethics, and
his work upon Rhetoric, but I mean to take him regularly
into both hands when I finish Plato's last page. Aristophanes
I took with me into Devonshire; and after all, I do not
know much more of <i>him</i> than three or four of his plays may
stand for. Next week, my very dear friend, I shall be at
your commands, and sit in spirit at your footstool, to hear
and answer anything you may care to ask me&mdash;but oh! what
have I done that you should talk to <i>me</i> about 'venturing,'
or 'liberty,' or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>From your affectionate and grateful catechumen,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i>.<br />
March 29, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I received your long letter and
receive your short one, and thank you for the pleasure of
both. Of course I am very <i>very</i> glad of your approval in
the matter of the papers, and your kindness could not have
wished to give me more satisfaction than it gave actually.
Mr. Kenyon tells me that Mr. Burgess<a name="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> has been reading and
commending the papers, and has brought me from him a
newly discovered scene of the 'Bacchae' of Euripides, edited
by Mr. Burgess himself for the 'Gentlemen's Magazine,' and
of which he considers that the 'Planctus Mariae,' at least the
passage I extracted from it, is an imitation. Should you
care to see it? Say 'Yes,'&mdash;and I will send it to you.</p>

<p>Do you think it was wrong to make <i>eternity</i> feminine?
I knew that the Greek word was not feminine; but imagined
that the English personification should be so. Am I wrong
in this? Will you consider the subject again?</p>

<p>Ah, yes! That was a mistake of mine about putting
Constantine for Constantius. I wrote from memory, and
the memory betrayed me. But say nothing about it.
Nobody will find it out. I send you Silentiarius and some
poems of Pisida in the same volume. Even if you had not
asked for them, I should have asked you to look at some
passages which are fine in both. It appears to me that
Silentiarius writes difficult Greek, overlaying his description
with a multitude of architectural and other far fetched words!
Pisida is hard, too, occasionally, from other causes, particularly
in the 'Hexa&euml;meron,' which is not in the book I send
you but in another very gigantic one (as tall as the Irish
giants), which you may see if you please. I will send a
coach and six with it if you please.</p>

<p>John Mauropus, of the Three Towns, I owe the knowledge
of to <i>you. You</i> lent me the book with his poems, you know.
He is a great favorite of mine in all ways. I very much
admire his poetry.</p>

<p>Believe me, ever your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Pray tell me what you think. I am sorry to observe
that the book I send you is marked very irregularly; that
is, marked in some places, unmarked in others, just as I
happened to be near or far from my pencil and inkstand.
Otherwise I should have liked to compare judgments with you.</p>

<p>Keep the book as long as you please; it is my own.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: April 2, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;... As to your kind desire to
hear whatever in the way of favorable remark I have
gathered together for fruit of my papers, I put on a veil and
tell you that Mr. Kenyon thought it well done, although
'labour thrown away, from the unpopularity of the subject;'
that Miss Mitford was very much pleased, with the warmheartedness
common to her; that Mrs. Jamieson [<i>sic</i>] read
them 'with great pleasure' unconsciously of the author;
and that Mr. Home the poet and Mr. Browning the poet
were not behind in approbation. Mr. Browning is said to
be learned in Greek, especially in the dramatists; and of
Mr. Home I should suspect something similar. Miss
Mitford and Mrs. Jamieson, although very gifted and highly
cultivated women, are not Grecians, and therefore judge the
papers simply as English compositions.</p>

<p>The single unfavorable opinion <i>is</i> Mr. Hunter's, who
thinks that the criticisms are not given with either sufficient
seriousness or diffidence, and that there is a painful sense of
effort through the whole. Many more persons may say so
whose voices I do not hear. I am glad that yours, my dear
indulgent friend, is not one of them.</p>

<p>Believe me, your ever affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
May 17, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;Have you thought all unkindness
out of my silence? Yet the inference is not a true one,
however it may look in logic.</p>

<p>You do not like Silentiarius <i>very much</i> (that is <i>my</i>
inference), since you have kept him so short a time. And I
quite agree with you that he is not a poet of the same
interest as Gregory Nazianzen, however he may appear to
me of more lofty cadence in his versification. My own
impression is that John of Euchaita is worth two of each of
them as a poet. His poems strike me as standing in the
very first class of the productions of the Christian centuries.
Synesius and John of Euchaita! I shall always think of
those two together&mdash;not by their similarity, but their dignity.</p>

<p>I return you the books you lent me with true thanks,
and also those which Mrs. Smith, I believe, left in your
hands for me. I thank <i>you</i> for them, and <i>you</i> must be good
enough to thank <i>her</i>. They were of use, although of a rather
sublime indifference for poets generally....</p>

<p>I shall send you soon the series of the Greek papers you
asked for, and also perhaps the first paper of a Survey of the
English Poets, under the pretence of a review of 'The Book
of the Poets,' a bookseller's selection published lately. I
begin from Langland, of Piers Plowman and the Malvern
Hills. The first paper went to the editor last week, and I
have heard nothing as to whether it will appear on Saturday
or not, and perhaps if it does you won't care to have it sent
to you. Tell me if you do or don't. I have suffered
unpleasantly in the heart lately from this tyrannous dynasty
of east winds, but have been well otherwise, and am better,
in <i>that</i>. Flushie means to bark the next time he sees you
in revenge for what you say of him.</p>

<p>Good bye, dear Mr. Boyd; think of me as</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
June 3, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I disobeyed you in not simply
letting you know of the publication of my 'English Poets,'
because I did not know myself when the publication was to
take place, and I hope you will forgive the innocent crime
and accept the first number going to you with this note. I
warn you that there will be two numbers more at <i>least</i>.
Therefore do not prepare yourself for perhaps the impossible
magnanimity of reading them through.</p>

<p>And now I am fit for rivalship with your clocks, papa
having given me an Aeolian harp for the purpose. Do you
know the music of an Aeolian harp, and that nothing below
the spherical harmonies is so sweet and soft and mournfully
wild? The amusing part of it is (after the poetical) that
Flushie is jealous and thinks it is alive, and takes it as very
hard that I should say 'beautiful' to anything except his
ears!</p>

<p>Arabel talks of going to see you; but if you are sensible
to this intense and most overcoming heat, you will pardon
her staying away for the present.</p>

<p>We have heard to-day that Annie proposes to publish
her Miscellany by subscription; and although I know it to
be the only way, compatible with publication at all, to avoid
a pecuniary loss, yet the custom is so entirely abandoned except
in the case of persons of a lower condition of life than
<i>your daughter</i>, that I am sorry to think of the observations
it may excite. The whole scheme has appeared to me from
the beginning <i>most foolish</i>, and if you knew what I know of
the state and fortune of our ephemeral literature, you would
use what influence you have with her to induce her to
condemn her 'contributions' to the adorning of a private
annual rather than the purpose in unhappy question. I
wish I dared to appeal through my true love for her to her
own good sense once more.</p>

you, your full and free opinion of them.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
June 22, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I thank you gratefully for your
two notes, with their united kindness and candour&mdash;the latter
still rarer than the former, if less 'sweet upon the tongue.'
Sir William Alexander's tragedy <i>(that</i> is the right name, I
think, Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling) you will not
find mentioned among my dramatic notices, because I was
much pressed for room, and had to treat the whole subject
as briefly as possible, striking off, like the Roman, only the
heads of the flowers, and I did not, besides, receive your
injunction until my third paper on the dramatists was
finished and in the press. When you read it you will find
some notice of that tragedy by Marlowe, the first knowledge of
which I owe to you, my dear Mr. Boyd, as how much besides?
And then comes the fourth paper, and I tremble to anticipate
the possible&mdash;nay, the very probable&mdash;scolding I may
have from you, upon my various heresies as to Dryden and
Pope and Queen Anne's versificators. In the meantime
you have breathing time, for Mr. Dilke, although very
gracious and courteous to my offence of extending the two
papers he asked for <i>into four</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> yet could find no room in
the 'Athenaeum' last week for me, and only <i>hopes</i> for it this
week. And after this week comes the British Association
business, which always fills every column for a month, so
that a further delay is possible enough. 'It will increase,'
says Mr. Dilke, 'the zest of the reader,' whereas <i>I</i> say (at
least think) that it will help him quite to forget me. I explain
all this lest you should blame me for neglect to yourself in
not sending the papers. I am so pleased that you like at
least the second article. That is encouragement to me.</p>

<p>Flushie did not seem to think the harp alive when it was
taken out of the window and laid close to him. He
examined it particularly, and is a philosophical dog. But I
am sure that at first and while it was playing he thought so.</p>

<p>In the same way he can't bear me to look into a glass,
because he thinks there is a little brown dog inside every
looking glass, and he is jealous of its being so close to <i>me</i>.
He used to tremble and bark at it, but now he is <i>silently</i>
jealous, and contents himself with squeezing close, close to
me and kissing me expressively.</p>

<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Sunday night [September 1842].<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Kenyon,&mdash;Having missed my pleasure
to-day by a coincidence worse for me than for you, I must,
tired as I am to-night, tell you&mdash;ready for to-morrow's
return of the books&mdash;what I have waited three whole
days hoping to tell you by word of mouth. But mind,
before I begin, I don't do so out of despair ever to
see you again, because I trust steadfastly to your kindness
to <i>come</i> again when <i>you</i> are not 'languid' and I am
alone as usual; only that I dare not keep back from you
any longer the following message of Miss Mitford. She
says: 'Won't he take us in his way to Torquay? or from
Torquay? Beg him to do so&mdash;and of all love, to tell us
<i>when</i>.' Afterwards, again: 'I think my father is better.
Tell Mr. Kenyon what I say, and stand my friend with him
and beg him to come.'</p>

<p>Which I do in the most effectual way&mdash;in her own
words.</p>

<p>She is much pleased by means of your introduction.
'Tell dear Mr. Kenyon how very very much I like Mrs.
Leslie. She seems all that is good and kind, and to add
great intelligence and agreeableness to these prime qualities.'</p>

<p>Now I have done with being a messenger of the gods,
and verily my caduceus is trembling in my hand.</p>

<p>O Mr. Kenyon! what have you done? You will know
the interpretation of the reproach, your conscience holding
the key of the cypher.</p>

<p>In the meantime I ought to be thanking you for your
great kindness about this divine Tennyson.<a name="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Beautiful!
beautiful! After all, it is a noble thing to be a poet.
But notwithstanding the poetry of the novelties&mdash;and
you will observe that his two preceding volumes (only
one of which I had seen before, having inquired for the
other vainly) are included in these two&mdash;nothing appears
to me quite equal to 'Oenone,' and perhaps a few besides
of my ancient favorites. That is not said in disparagement
of the last, but in admiration of the first. There is, in
fact, more thought&mdash;more bare brave working of the
intellect&mdash;in the latter poems, even if we miss something
of the high ideality, and the music that goes with it, of the
older ones. Only I am always inclined to believe that
philosophic thinking, like music, is involved, however
occultly, in high ideality of any kind.</p>

<p>You have not a key to the cypher of this at least, and I
am so tired that one word seems tumbling over another all
the way.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>You will let me keep your beautiful ballad and the gods<a name="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>
a little longer.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
September 14, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I have made you wait a long
time for the 'North American Review,' because when your
request came it was no longer within my reach, and because
since then I have not been so well as usual from a sweep of
the wing of the prevailing epidemic. Now, however, I am
<i>better</i> than I was even before the attack, only wishing that it
were possible to hook-and-eye on another summer to the hem
of the garment of this last sunny one. At the end of such a
double summer, to measure things humanly, I might be able
to go to see you at Hampstead. Nevertheless, winters and
adversities are more fit for us than a constant sun.</p>

<p>I suppose, dear Mr. Boyd, you want only to have this
review read to you, and not <i>written</i>. Because it isn't out of
laziness that I send the book to you; and Arabel would
copy whatever you please willingly, provided you wished it.
Keep the book as long as you please. I have put a paper
mark and a pencil mark at the page and paragraph where
I am taken up. It seems to me that the condemnation of
'The Seraphim' is not too hard. The poem wants <i>unity</i>.</p>

<p>As to your 'words of fire' about Wordsworth, if I had
but a cataract at command I would try to quench them.
His powers should not be judged of by my extracts or by
anybody's extracts from his last-published volume.<a name="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> Do you
remember his grand ode upon Childhood&mdash;worth, to my
apprehension, just twenty of Dryden's 'St. Cecilia's Day'&mdash;his
sonnet upon Westminster Bridge, his lyric on a lark, in
which the lark's music swells and exults, and the many
noble and glorious passages of his 'Excursion'? You
must not indeed blame me for estimating Wordsworth
at <i>his height</i>, and on the other side I readily confess to you
that he is occasionally, and not unfrequently, heavy and dull,
and that Coleridge had an intenser genius. Tell me if you
know anything of Tennyson. He has just published two
volumes of poetry, one of which is a republication, but
both full of inspiration.</p>

<p>Ever my very dear friend's affectionate and grateful<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />



<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: October 22, 1842.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Waiting first for you to write
to me, and then waiting that I might write to you cheerfully,
has ended by making so long a silence that I am almost
ashamed to break it. And perhaps, even if I were not
ashamed, you would be angry&mdash;perhaps you <i>are</i> angry,
and don't much care now whether or not you ever
hear from me again. Still I must write, and I must
moreover ask you to write to me again; and I must in
particular assure you that I have continued to love you
sincerely, notwithstanding all the silence which might seem
to say the contrary. What I should like best just now is to
have a letter speaking comfortable details of your being
comparatively well again; yet I hope on without it that you
really are so much better as to be next to quite well. It
was with great concern that I heard of the indisposition
which hung about you, dearest Mrs. Martin, so long&mdash;I
who had congratulated myself when I saw you last on the
promise of good health in your countenance. May God
bless you, and keep you better! And may you take care
of yourself, and remember how many love you in the world,
from dear Mr. Martin down to&mdash;E.B.B.</p>

<p>Well, now I must look around me and consider what
there is to tell you. But I have been uneasy in various
ways, sometimes by reason and sometimes by fantasy; and
even now, although my dear old friend Dr. Scully is something
better, he lies, I fear, in a very precarious state, while
dearest Miss Mitford's letters from the deathbed of her
father make my heart ache as surely almost as the post
comes. There is nothing more various in character,
nothing which distinguishes one human being from another
more strikingly, than the expression of feeling, the manner
in which it influences the outward man. If I were in
her circumstances, I should sit paralysed&mdash;it would be
impossible to me to write or to cry. And she, who loves
and feels with the intensity of a nature warm in everything,
seems to turn to sympathy by the very instinct of grief, and
sits at the deathbed of her last relative, writing there, in
letter after letter, every symptom, physical or moral&mdash;even
to the very words of the raving of a delirium, and those,
heart-breaking words! I could not write such letters; but
I know she feels as deeply as any mourner in the world can.
And all this reminds me of what you once asked me about
the inscriptions in Lord Brougham's villa at Nice. There
are probably as many different dialects for the heart as for
the tongue, are there not?...</p>

<p>And now you will kindly like to have a word said about
myself, and it need not be otherwise than a word to give
your kindness pleasure. The long splendid summer,
exhausting as the heat was to me sometimes, did me
essential good, and left me walking about the room and
equal to going downstairs (which I achieved four or
five times), and even to going out in the chair, without
suffering afterwards. And, best of all, the spitting of
blood (I must tell you), which more or less kept by me
continually, <i>stopped quite</i> some six weeks ago, and I
have thus more reasonable hopes of being really and
essentially better than I could have with such a symptom
loitering behind accidental improvements. Weak enough,
and with a sort of pulse which is not excellent, I certainly
remain; but still, if I escape any decided attack this winter&mdash;and
I am in garrison now&mdash;there are expectations of
further good for next summer, and I may recover some
moderate degree of health and strength again, and be able
to <i>do</i> good instead of receiving it only.</p>

<p>I write under the eyes of Wordsworth. Not Wordsworth's
living eyes, although the actual living poet had the
infinite kindness to ask Mr. Kenyon twice last summer
when he was in London, if he might not come to see me.
Mr. Kenyon said 'No'&mdash;I couldn't have said 'No' to
Wordsworth, though I had never gone to sleep again
afterwards. But this Wordsworth who looks on me now is
Wordsworth in a picture. Mr. Haydon the artist, with the
utmost kindness, has sent me the portrait he was painting
of the great poet&mdash;an unfinished portrait&mdash;and I am to
keep it until he wants to finish it. Such a head! such
majesty! and the poet stands musing upon Helvellyn!
And all that&mdash;poet, Helvellyn, and all&mdash;is in my room!<a name="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p>Give my kind love to Mr. Martin&mdash;<i>our</i> kind love, indeed,
to both of you&mdash;and believe me, my dearest Mrs. Martin,</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate BA.</p>

<p>Is there any hope for us of you before the winter ends?
Do consider.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Monday, October 31, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I have put off from day to day
sending you these volumes, and in the meantime <i>I have
had a letter from the great poet</i>! Did Arabel tell you that my
sonnet on the picture was sent to Mr. Haydon, and that Mr.
Haydon sent it to Mr. Wordsworth? The result was that
Mr. Wordsworth wrote to me. King John's barons were never
better pleased with their Charta than I am with this letter.<a name="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>
<br />

<p>But I won't tell you any more about it until you have
read the poems which I send you. Read first, to put you
into good humour, the sonnet written on Westminster
Bridge, vol. iii. page 78. Then take from the sixth volume,
page 152, the passage beginning 'Within the soul' down to
page 153 at 'despair,' and again at page 155 beginning with</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have seen</span><br />
A curious child, &amp;c.<br />
</div>

<p>down to page 157 to the end of the paragraph. If you admit
these passages to be fine poetry, I wish much that you would
justify me further by reading, out of the <i>second</i> volume, the
two poems called 'Laodamia' and 'Tintern Abbey' at page
172 and page 161. I will not ask you to read any more; but
I dare say you will rush on of your own account, in which
case there is a fine ode upon the 'Power of Sound' in the
same volume. Wordsworth is a philosophical and Christian
poet, with depths in his soul to which poor Byron could
never reach. Do be candid. Nay, I need not say so,
because you always are, as I am,</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
December 4, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;You will think me in a discontented
state of mind when I knit my brows like a 'sleeve of
care' over your kind praises. But the truth is, I <i>won't</i> be
praised for being liberal in Calvinism and love of Byron.
<i>I</i> liberal in commending Byron! Take out my heart and
try it! look at it and compare it with yours; and answer
and tell me if I do not love and admire Byron more warmly
than you yourself do. I suspect it indeed. Why, I am
always reproached for my love to Byron. Why, people say
to me, '<i>You</i>, who overpraise Byron!' Why, when I was
a little girl (and, whatever you may think, my tendency is
not to cast off my old loves!) I used to think seriously of
dressing up like a boy and running away to be Lord Byron's
page. And <i>I</i> to be praised now for being 'liberal' in
admitting the merit of his poetry! <i>I</i>!</p>

<p>As for the Calvinism, I don't choose to be liberal there
either. I don't call myself a Calvinist. I hang suspended
between the two doctrines, and hide my eyes in God's love
from the sights which other people <i>say</i> they see. I believe
simply that the saved are saved by grace, and that they
shall hereafter know it fully; and that the lost are lost by
their choice and free will&mdash;by choosing to sin and die; and
I believe absolutely that the deepest damned of all the lost
will not dare to whisper to the nearest devil that reproach
of Martha: 'If the Lord had been near me, I had not
died.' But of the means of the working of God's grace,
and of the time of the formation of the Divine counsels, I
know nothing, guess nothing, and struggle to guess nothing;
and my persuasion is that when people talk of what was
ordained or approved by God before the foundations of the
world, their tendency is almost always towards a confusion
of His eternal nature with the human conditions of ours;
and to an oblivion of the fact that with <i>Him</i> there can be
no after nor before.</p>

<p>At any rate, I do not find it good for myself to examine
any more the brickbats of controversy&mdash;there is more
than enough to think of in truths clearly revealed; more
than enough for the exercise of the intellect and affections
and adorations. I would rather not suffer myself to be
disturbed, and perhaps irritated, where it is not likely that
I should ever be informed. And although you tell me
that your system of investigation is different from some
others, answer me with your accustomed candour, and
admit, my very dear friend, that this argument does
not depend upon the construction of a Greek sentence or
the meaning of a Greek word. Let a certain word<a name="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> be
'fore-know' or 'publicly <i>favor</i>,' room for a stormy
controversy yet remains. I went through the Romans with
you partially, and wholly by myself, by your desire, and
in reference to the controversy, long ago; and I could not
then, and cannot now, enter into that view of Taylor and
Adam Clarke, and yourself I believe, as to the <i>Jews and
Gentiles</i>. Neither could I conceive that a particular part of
the epistle represents an actual dialogue between a Jew and
Gentile, since the form of question and answer appears to
me there simply rhetorical. The Apostle Paul was learned in
rhetoric; and I think he described so, by a rhetorical and
vivacious form, that struggle between the flesh and the
spirit common to all Christians; the spirit being triumphant
through God in Christ Jesus. These are my impressions.
Yours are different. And since we should not probably
persuade each other, and since we are both of us fond of
and earnest in what we fancy to be the truth, why should
we cast away the thousand sympathies we rejoice in,
religious and otherwise, for the sake of a fruitless
contention? 'What!' you would say (by the time we had
quarrelled half an hour), 'can't you talk without being
excited?' Half an hour afterwards: 'Pray <i>do</i> lower your
voice&mdash;it goes through my head!' In another ten minutes:
'I could scarcely have believed you to be so obstinate.'
In another: 'Your prejudices are insurmountable, and your
reason most womanly&mdash;you are degenerated to the last degree.'
In another&mdash;why, <i>then</i> you would turn me and Flush
out of the room and so finish the controversy victoriously.</p>

<p>Was I wrong too, dearest Mr. Boyd, in sending the
poems to the 'Athenaeum'? Well, I meant to be right. I
fancied that you would rather they were sent; and as your
<i>name</i> was not attached, there could be no harm in leaving
them to the editor's disposal. They are not inserted, as I
anticipated. The religious character was a sufficient
objection&mdash;their character of <i>prayer</i>. Mr. Dilke begged
me once, while I was writing for him, to write the name of God
and Jesus Christ as little as I could, because those names
did not accord with the secular character of the journal!</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Tell me how you like the sonnet; but you won't (I
prophesy) like it. Keep the 'Athenaeum.'</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
December 24, 1842.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I am afraid that you will infer
from my silence that you have affronted me into ill temper
by your parody upon my sonnet. Yet 'lucus a non lucendo'
were a truer derivation. I laughed and thanked you over
the parody, and put off writing to you until I had the headache,
which forced me to put it off again....</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear Mr. Boyd. Mr. Savage
Landor once said that anybody who could write a parody
deserved to be shot; but as he has written one himself
since saying so, he has probably changed his mind. Arabel
sends her love.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
January 5, 1842 [1843].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;My surprise was inexpressible at
your utterance of the name. What! Ossian superior as a
poet to Homer! Mr. Boyd saying so! Mr. Boyd treading
down the neck of Aeschylus while he praises Ossian!
The fact appears to me that anomalous thing among
believers&mdash;a miracle without an occasion.</p>

<p>I confess I never, never should have guessed the name;
not though I had guessed to Doomsday. In the first place I
do not believe in Ossian, and having partially examined the
testimony (for I don't pretend to any exact learning about
it) I consider him as the poetical <i>lay figure</i> upon which Mr.
Macpherson dared to cast his personality. There is a sort
of phraseology, nay, an identity of occasional phrases, from
the antique&mdash;but that these so-called Ossianic poems were
ever discovered and translated as they stand in their present
form, I believe in no wise. As Dr. Johnson wrote to
Macpherson, so I would say, 'Mr. Macpherson, I thought
you an impostor, and think so still.'</p>

<p>It is many years ago since I looked at Ossian, and I
never did much delight in him, as that fact proves. Since
your letter came I have taken him up again, and have just
finished 'Carthon.' There are beautiful passages in it, the
most beautiful beginning, I think, 'Desolate is the dwelling
of Moina,' and the next place being filled by that address to
the sun you magnify so with praise. But the charm of
these things is the <i>only</i> charm of all the poems. There is
a sound of wild vague music in a monotone&mdash;nothing is
articulate, nothing <i>individual</i>, nothing various. Take away
a few poetical phrases from these poems, and they are
colourless and bare. Compare them with the old burning
ballads, with a wild heart beating in each. How cold
they grow in the comparison! Compare them with Homer's
grand breathing personalities, with Aeschylus's&mdash;nay, but I
cannot bear upon my lips or finger the charge of the
blasphemy of such comparing, even for religion's sake....</p>

<p>I had another letter from America a few days since, from
an American poet of Boston who is establishing a magazine,
and asked for contributions from my pen. The Americans
are as good-natured to me as if they took me for the high
Radical I am, you know.</p>

<p>You won't be angry with me for my obliquity (as you
will consider it) about Ossian. You know I always talk
sincerely to you, and you have not made me afraid of telling
you the truth&mdash;that is, <i>my</i> truth, the truth of my belief and
opinions.</p>

<p>I do not defend much in the 'Idiot Boy.' Wordsworth
is a great poet, but he does not always write equally.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of a distinction you suggest
between Ossian and Homer. <i>I</i> fashion it in this way:
Homer sometimes nods, but Ossian <i>makes his readers nod</i>.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that I had been reading through a manuscript
translation of the 'Gorgias' of Plato, by Mr. Hyman of
Oxford, who is a stepson of Mr. Haydon's the artist? It
is an excellent translation with learned notes, but it is <i>not
elegant</i>. He means to try the public upon it, but, as I have
intimated to him, the Christians of the present day are not
civilised enough for Plato.</p>

<p>Arabel's love.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[About the end of January 1843.]<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;The image you particularly admire
in Ossian, I admire with you, although I am not sure that
I have not seen it or its like somewhere in a classical poet,
Greek or Latin. Perhaps Lord Byron remembered it when
in the 'Siege of Corinth' he said of his Francesca's uplifted
arm, 'You might have seen the moon shine through.' It
reminds me also that Maclise the artist, a man of poetical
imagination, gives such a transparency to the ghost of
Banquo in his picture of Macbeth's banquet, that we can
discern through it the lights of the festival. That is good
poetry for a painter, is it not?</p>

<p>I send you the magazines which I have just received
from America, and which contain, one of them, 'The Cry
of the Human,' and the other, four of my sonnets. My
correspondent tells me that the 'Cry' is considered there
one of the most successful of my poems, but you probably
will not think so. Tell me exactly what you do think. At
page 343 of 'Graham's Magazine,' <i>Editor's Table</i>, is a review
of me, which, however extravagant in its appreciation, will
give your kindness pleasure. I confess to a good deal of
pleasure myself from these American courtesies, expressed
not merely in the magazines, but in the newspapers; a heap
of which has been sent to me by my correspondent&mdash;the
'New York Tribune,' 'The Union,' 'The Union Flag,' &amp;c.&mdash;all
scattered over with extracts from my books and benignant
words about their writer. Among the extracts is the whole
of the review of Wordsworth from the London 'Athenaeum,'
an unconscious compliment, as they do not guess at the
authorship, and one which you won't thank them for. Keep
the magazines, as I have duplicates.</p>

<p>Dearest Mr. Boyd, since you admit that I am not
prejudiced about Ossian, I take courage to tell you what I
am thinking of.</p>

<p><i>I am thinking</i> (this is said in a whisper, and in
confidence&mdash;of two kinds), <i>I am thinking that you don't
admire him quite as much as you did three weeks ago</i>.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Arabel not being here, I send her love without asking
for it.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
January 30, 1843.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Thank you for your letter
and for dear Mr. Martin's thought of writing one! Ah! <i>I</i>
thought he would not write, but not for the reason you say;
it was something more palpable and less romantic! Well,
I will not grumble any more about not having my letter,
since you are coming, and since you seem, my dear Mrs.
Martin, something in better spirits than your note from
Southampton bore token of. Madeira is the Promised Land,
you know; and you should hope hopefully for your invalid
from his pilgrimage there. You should hope with those
who hope, my dearest Mrs. Martin....</p>

<p>Our '<i>event</i>' just now is a new purchase of a 'Holy
Family,' supposed to be by Andrea del Sarto. It has displaced
the Glover over the chimney-piece in the drawing-room,
and dear Stormie and Alfred nearly broke their backs
in carrying it upstairs for me to see before the placing. It is
probably a fine picture, and I seem to see my way through
the dark of my ignorance, to admire the grouping and
colouring, whatever doubt as to the expression and divinity
may occur otherwise. Well, you will judge. I won't tell
you <i>how</i> I think of it. And you won't care if I do. There
is also a new very pretty landscape piece, and you may
imagine the local politics of the arrangement and hanging,
with their talk and consultation; while <i>I</i>, on the storey
higher, have my arranging to manage of my pretty new
books and my three hyacinths, and a pot of primroses which
dear Mr. Kenyon had the good nature to carry himself
through the streets to our door. But all the flowers forswear
me, and die either suddenly or gradually as soon as they
become aware of the want of fresh air and light in my room.
Talking of air and light, what exquisite weather this is!
What a summer in winter! It is the fourth day since I
have had the fire wrung from me by the heat of temperature,
and I sit here <i>very warm indeed</i>, notwithstanding that bare
grate. Nay, yesterday I had the door thrown open for
above an hour, and was warm still! You need not ask, you
see, how I am.</p>

<p>Tell me, have you read Mr. Dickens's 'America;' and
what is your thought of it like? If I were an American, it
would make me rabid, and certain of the free citizens <i>are</i>
furious, I understand, while others 'speak peace and
ensue it,' admire as much of the book as deserves any sort of
admiration, and attribute the blameable parts to the prejudices
of the party with whom the writer 'fell in,' and not
to a want of honesty or brotherhood in his own intentions.
I admire Mr. Dickens as an imaginative writer, and I love
the Americans&mdash;I cannot possibly admire or love this book.
Does Mr. Martin? Do <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>Henrietta would send her love to you if I could hear
her voice nearer than I do actually, as she sings to the
guitar downstairs. And her love is not the only one to be
sent. Give mine to dear Mr. Martin, though he can't make
up his mind to the bore of writing to me. And remember
us all, both of you, as we do you.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin, your affectionate BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To James Martin</i><br />
February 6, 1843.<br />

<p>You make us out, my dear Mr. Martin, to be such perfect
parallel lines that I should be half afraid of completing the
definition by our never meeting, if it were not for what you
say afterwards, of the coming to London, and of promising
to come and see Flush. If you should be travelling while I
am writing, it was only what happened to me when I wrote
not long ago to dearest Mrs. Martin, and everybody in this
house cried out against the fatuity of the coincidence. As
if I could know that she was travelling, when nobody told
me, and I wasn't a witch! If the same thing happens to-day,
believe in the innocence of my ignorance. I shall be consoled
if it does&mdash;for certain reasons. But for none in the
world can I help thanking you for your letter, which gave
me so much pleasure from the first sight of the handwriting
to the thought of the kindness spent upon me in it, that
after all I cannot thank you as I would.</p>

<p>Yet I won't let you fancy me of such an irrational state
of simplicity as not to be fully aware that <i>you</i>, with your
'nature of the fields and forests,' look down disdainfully and
with an inward heat of glorying, upon <i>me</i> who have all my
pastime in books&mdash;dead and seethed. Perhaps, if it were
a little warmer, I might even grant that you are right in
your pride. As it is, I grumble feebly to myself something
about the definition of <i>nature</i>, and how we in the town
(which 'God made' just as He made your hedges) have <i>our</i>
share of nature too; and then I have secret thoughts of
the state of the thermometer, and wonder how people can
breathe out of doors. In the meantime, Flush, who is a
better philosopher, pushes deep into my furs, and goes to
sleep. Perhaps I should fear the omen for my correspondent.</p>

<p>Oh yes! That picture in 'Boz' is beautiful. For my
own part, and by a natural womanly contradiction, I have
never cared so much in my life for flowers as since being
shut out from gardens&mdash;unless, indeed, in the happy days of
old when I had a garden of my own, and cut it out into a
great Hector of Troy, in relievo, with a high heroic box nose
and shoeties of columbine.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> But that was long ago. Now
I count the buds of my primrose with a new kind of interest,
and you never saw such a primrose! I begin to believe in
Ovid, and look for a metamorphosis. The leaves are turning
white and springing up as high as corn. Want of air, and
of sun, I suppose. I should be loth to think it&mdash;want of
friendship to <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>Do you know that the royal Boz lives close to us, three
doors from Mr. Kenyon in Harley Place? The new
numbers appear to me admirable, and full of life and
blood&mdash;whatever we may say to the thick rouging and
extravagance of gesture. There is a beauty, a tenderness,
too, in the organ scene, which is worthy of the gilliflowers.
But my admiration for 'Boz' fell from its 'sticking place,' I
confess, a good furlong, when I read Victor Hugo; and my
creed is, that, <i>not</i> in his tenderness, which is as much his
own as his humour, but in his serious powerful Jew-trial
scenes, he has followed Hugo closely, and never scarcely
looked away from 'Les Trois Jours d'un Condamn&eacute;.'</p>

<p>If you should not be on the road, I hope you won't be
very long before you are, and that dearest Mrs. Martin will
put off building her greenhouse&mdash;you see I believe she <i>will</i>
build it&mdash;until she gets home again.</p>

<p>How kind of you and of her to have poor old Mrs.
Barker at Colwall!</p>

<p>Do believe me, both of you, with love from all of <i>us</i>,</p>

<p>Very affectionately yours,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
February 21, 1843.<br />

<p>Thank you, my very dear friend, I am as well as the
east wind will suffer me to be; and <i>that</i>, indeed, is not very
well, my heart being fuller of all manner of evil than is
necessary to its humanity. But the wind is changed, and
the frost is gone, and it is not quite out of my fancy yet that
I may see you next summer. <i>You and summer are not out
of the question yet</i>. Therefore, you see, I cannot be very
deep in tribulation. But you may consider it a bad symptom
that I have just finished a poem of some five hundred lines
in stanzas, called 'The Lost Bower,'<a name="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> and about nothing at
all in particular.</p>

<p>As to Arabel, she is not an icicle. There are flowers
which blow in the frost&mdash;when we brambles are brown with
their inward death&mdash;and she is of them, dear thing. <i>You</i>
are not a bramble, though, and I hope that when you talk
of 'feeling the cold,' you mean simply to refer to your
sensation, and not to your health. Remember also, dearest
Mr. Boyd, what a glorious winter we have had. Take away
the last ten days and a few besides, and call the whole
summer rather than winter. Ought we to complain, really?
Really, no.</p>

<p>I venture another prophecy upon the shoulders of the
ast, though my hand shakes so that nobody will read it.</p>

<p><i>You can't abide my 'Cry of the Human,' and four sonnets</i>.
They have none of them found favor in your eyes.</p>

<p>In or out of favor,</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate E.B.B.</p>

<p>Do you think that next summer you <i>might, could</i>, or
<i>would</i> walk across the park to see me&mdash;supposing always
that I fail in my aspiration to go and see you? I only ask
by way of <i>hypothesis</i>. Consider and revolve it so. We live
on the verge of the town rather than in it, and our noises
are cousins to silence; and you should pass into a room
where the silence is most absolute. Flush's breathing is my
loudest sound, and then the watch's tickings, and then my
own heart when it beats too turbulently. Judge of the
quiet and the solitude!</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
April 19, 1843.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;The earth turns round, to be
sure, and we turn with it, but I never anticipated the day
and the hour for <i>you</i> to turn round and be guilty of high
treason to our Greeks. I cry '<i>Ai</i>! <i>ai</i>!' as if I were a
chorus, and all vainly. For, you see, arguing about it will
only convince you of my obstinacy, and not a bit of Homer's
supremacy. Ossian has wrapt you in a cloud, a fog, a true
Scotch mist. You have caught cold in the critical faculty,
perhaps. At any rate, I can't see a bit more of your
reasonableness than I can see of Fingal. <i>Sic transit</i>!
Homer like the darkened half of the moon in eclipse!
You have spoilt for me now the finest image in your
Ossian-Macpherson.</p>

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd, you will find as few believers in
the genuineness of these volumes among the most
accomplished antiquarians in poetry as in the genuineness
of Chatterton's Rowley, and of Ireland's Shakespeare.
The latter impostures boasted of disciples in the first
instance, but the discipleship perished by degrees, and the
place thereof, during this present 1843, knows it no more.
So has it been with the belief in Macpherson's Ossian. Of
those who believed in the poems at the first sight of them,
who kept his creed to the end? And speaking so, I speak
of Macpherson's contemporaries whom you respect.</p>

<p>I do not consider Walter Scott a great poet, but he was
highly accomplished in matters of poetical antiquarianism,
and is certainly citable as an authority on this question.</p>

<p>Try not to be displeased with me. I cannot conceal
from you that my astonishment is profound and unutterable
at your new religion&mdash;your new faith in this pseud-Ossian&mdash;and
your desecration, in his service, of the old Hellenic
altars. And by the way, my own figure reminds me to inquire
of you whether you are not sometimes struck with a <i>want</i>
in him&mdash;a want very grave in poetry, and very strange
in antique poetry&mdash;the want of devotional feeling and
conscience of God. Observe, that all antique poets rejoice
greatly and abundantly in their divine mythology; and
that if this Ossian be both antique and godless, he is an
exception, a discrepancy, a monster in the history of letters
and experience of humanity. As such I leave him.</p>

<p>Oh, how angry you will be with me. But you seemed
tolerably prepared in your last letter for my being in a
passion.... Ever affectionately yours,</p>

<p>ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>Why should I be angry with Flush? <i>He</i> does not
believe in Ossian. Oh, I assure you he doesn't.</p>

<p>The following letter was called forth by a criticism of
Mr. Kenyon's on Miss Barrett's poem, <i>The Dead Pan</i>, which
he had seen in manuscript; but it also meets some criticisms
which others had made upon her last volume (see above,
p. 65).</p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Wimpole Street: March 25, 1843.<br />

<p>My very dear Cousin,&mdash;Your kindness having touched
me much, and your good opinion, whether literary or otherwise,
being of great price to me, it is even with tears in my
eyes that I begin to write to you upon a difference between
us. And what am I to say? To admit, of course, in the
first place, the injuriousness to the 'popularity,' of the
scriptural tone. But am I to sacrifice a principle to
popularity? Would you advise me to do so? Should I be
more worthy of your kindness by doing so? and could you
(apart from the kindness) call my refusal to do so either
perverseness or obstinacy? Even if you could, I hope you
will try a little to be patient with me, and to forgive, at least,
what you find it impossible to approve.</p>

<p>My dear cousin, if you had not reminded me of
Wordsworth's exclamation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">I would rather be</span><br />
A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>and if he had never made it, I do think that its significance
would have occurred to me, by a sort of instinct,
in connection with this discussion. Certainly <i>I</i> would
rather be a pagan whose religion was actual, earnest,
continual&mdash;for week days, work days, and song days&mdash;than
I would be a <i>Christian</i> who, from whatever motive,
shrank from hearing or uttering the name of Christ out of
a 'church.' I am no fanatic, but I like truth and earnestness
in all things, and I cannot choose but believe that such
a Christian shows but ill beside such a pagan. What pagan
poet ever thought of casting his gods out of his poetry?
In what pagan poem do they not shine and thunder? And
if <i>I</i>&mdash;to approach the point in question&mdash;if <i>I</i>, writing
a poem the end of which is the extolment of what
I consider to be Christian truth over the pagan myths
shrank even <i>there</i> from naming the name of my God lest it
should not meet the sympathies of some readers, or lest it
should offend the delicacies of other readers, or lest,
generally, it should be unfit for the purposes of poetry
in what more forcible manner than by that act (I appeal to
Philip against Philip) can I controvert my own poem, or
secure to myself and my argument a logical and unanswerable
shame? If Christ's name is improperly spoken
in that poem, then indeed is Schiller right, and the true
gods of poetry are to be sighed for mournfully. For be
sure that <i>Burns</i> was right, and that a poet without devotion
is below his own order, and that poetry without religion will
gradually lose its elevation. And then, my dear friend, we
do not live among dreams. The Christian religion is true
or it is not, and if it is true it offers the highest and purest
objects of contemplation. And the poetical faculty, which
expresses the highest moods of the mind, passes naturally
to the highest objects. Who can separate these things?
Did Dante? Did Tasso? Did Petrarch? Did Calderon?
Did Chaucer? Did the poets of our best British days?
Did any one of these shrink from speaking out Divine
names when the occasion came? Chaucer, with all his
jubilee of spirit and resounding laughter, had the name of
Jesus Christ and God as frequently to familiarity on his lips
as a child has its father's name. You say 'our religion is
not vital&mdash;not week-day&mdash;enough.' Forgive me, but <i>that</i>
is a confession of a wrong, not an argument. And if a
poet be a poet, it is his business to work for the elevation
and purification of the public mind, rather than for his
own popularity! while if he be not a poet, no sacrifice of
self-respect will make amends for a defective faculty, nor
<i>ought</i> to make amends.</p>

<p>My conviction is that the <i>poetry of Christianity</i> will one
day be developed greatly and nobly, and that in the meantime
we are wrong, poetically as morally, in desiring to
restrain it. No, I never felt repelled by any Christian
phraseology in Cowper&mdash;although he is not a favorite poet
of mine from other causes&mdash;nor in Southey, nor even in
James Montgomery, nor in Wordsworth where he writes
'ecclesiastically,' nor in Christopher North, nor in
Chateaubriand, nor in Lamartine.</p>

<p>It is but two days ago since I had a letter&mdash;and not
from a fanatic&mdash;to reproach my poetry for not being
Christian enough, and this is not the first instance, nor the
second, of my receiving such a reproach. I tell you this to
open to you the possibility of another side to the question,
which makes, you see, a triangle of it!</p>

<p>Can you bear with such a long answer to your letter,
and forbear calling it a 'preachment'? There may be
such a thing as an awkward and untimely introduction of
religion, I know, and I have possibly been occasionally
guilty in this way. But for <i>my principle</i> I must contend,
for it is a poetical principle <i>and more</i>, and an entire sincerity
in respect to it is what I owe to you and to myself. Try to
forgive me, dear Mr. Kenyon. I would propitiate your
indulgence for me by a libation of your own eau de
Cologne poured out at your feet! It is excellent eau de
Cologne, and you are very kind to me, but, notwithstanding
all, there is a foreboding within me that my 'conventicleisms'
will be inodorous in your nostrils.</p>

<p>[<i>Incomplete</i>.]</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
Tuesday [about March 1843].<br />

<p>My very dear Cousin,&mdash;I have read your letter again
and again, and feel your kindness fully and earnestly. You
have advised me about the poem,<a name="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> entering into the questions
referring to it with the warmth rather of the author of
it than the critic of it, and this I am sensible of as absolutely
as anyone can be. At the same time, I have a strong
perception rather than opinion about the poem, and also, if
you would not think it too serious a word to use in such a
place, I have a <i>conscience</i> about it. It was not written in a
desultory fragmentary way, the last stanzas thrown in, as they
might be thrown out, but with a <i>design</i>, which leans its whole
burden on the last stanzas. In fact, the last stanzas were in
my mind to say, and all the others presented the mere
avenue to the end of saying them. Therefore I cannot
throw them out&mdash;I cannot yield to the temptation even
of pleasing <i>you</i> by doing so; I make a compromise with
myself, and <i>do not throw them out, and do not print the poem</i>.
Now say nothing against this, my dear cousin, because I am
obstinate, as you know, as you have good evidence for
knowing. I <i>will not</i> either alter or print it. Then you have
your manuscript copy, which you can cut into any shape
you please as long as you keep it out of print; and seeing
that the poem really does belong to you, having had its
origin in your paraphrase of Schiller's stanzas, I see a great
deal of poetical justice in the manuscript copyright remaining
in your hands. For the rest I shall have quite enough
to print and to be responsible for without it, and I am
quite satisfied to let it be silent for a few years until either
I or you (as may be the case even with <i>me</i>!) shall have
revised our judgments in relation to it.</p>

<p>This being settled, you must suffer me to explain (for
mere personal reasons, and not for the good of the poem)
that no mortal priest (of St. Peter's or otherwise) is referred
to in a particular stanza, but the Saviour Himself. Who is
'the High Priest of our profession,' and the only 'priest'
recognised in the New Testament. In the same way the
altar candles are altogether spiritual, or they could not be
supposed, even by the most amazing poetical exaggeration,
to 'light the earth and skies.' I explain this, only that I
may not appear to you to have compromised the principle
of the poem, by compromising any truth (such in my eyes)
for the sake of a poetical effect.</p>

<p>And now I will not say any more. I know that you will
be inclined to cry, 'Print it in any case,' but I will entreat
of your kindness, which I have so much right to trust in
while entreating, <i>not to say one such word. Be kind, and let
me follow my own way silently</i>. I have not, indeed, like a
spoilt child in a fret, thrown the poem up because I would
not alter it, though you have done much to spoil me. I
act advisedly, and have made up my mind as to what is the
wisest and best thing to do, and personally the pleasantest
to myself, after a good deal of serious reflection. 'Pan is
dead,' and so best, for the present at least.</p>

<p>I shall take your advice about the preface in every
respect, and thanks for the letter and Taylor's memoirs.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford talks of coming to town for a day, and of
bringing Flush with her, as soon as the weather settles, and
to-day looks so like it that I have mused this morning on
the possibility of breaking my prison doors and getting into
the next room. Only there is a forbidding north wind, they say.</p>

<p>Don't be vexed with me, dear Mr. Kenyon. You know
there are obstinacies in the world as well as mortalities, and
thereto appertaining. And then you will perceive through
all mine, that it is difficult for me to act against your judgment
so far as to put my own tenacity into print.</p>

<p>Ever gratefully and affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>It is to the honour of America that it recognised from
the first the genius of Miss Barrett; and for a large part of
her life some of the closest of her personal and literary
connections were with Americans. The same is true in
both respects of Robert Browning. As appears from some
letters printed farther on in these volumes, at a time when
the sale of his poems in England was almost infinitesimal,
they were known and highly prized in the United States.
Expressions of Mrs. Browning's sympathy with America and
of gratitude for the kindly feelings of Americans recur
frequently in the letters, and it is probable that there are
still extant in the States many letters written to friends and
correspondents there. Only three or four such have been made
available for the present collection; and of these the first
follows here in its place in the chronological sequence. It
was written to Mr. Cornelius Mathews, then editor of
'Graham's Magazine,' who had invited Miss Barrett to send
contributions to his periodical. The warm expression in it
of sympathy with the poetry of Robert Browning, whom she
did not yet know personally, is especially interesting to
readers of this later day, who, like the spectators at a Greek
tragedy, watch the development of a drama of which the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is already known to them.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Cornelius Mathews</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: April 28, 1843.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Mathews,&mdash;In replying to your kind letter
I send some more verse for Graham's, praying such demi-semi-gods
as preside over contributors to magazines that I
may not appear over-loquacious to my editor. Of course
it is not intended to thrust three or four poems into one
number. My pluralities go to you simply to 'bide your
time,' and be used one by one as the opportunity is presented.
In the meanwhile you have received, I hope, a short letter
written to explain my unwillingness to apply, as you desired
me at first, to Wiley and Putnam&mdash;an unwillingness
justified by what you told me afterwards. I did not apply,
nor have I applied, and I would rather not apply at all.
Perhaps I shall hear from them presently. The pamphlet
on International Copyright is welcome at a distance, but it
has not come near me yet; and for all your kindness in
relation to the prospective gift of your works I thank you
again and earnestly. You are kind to me in many ways,
and I would willingly know as much of your intellectual
habits as you teach me of your genial feelings. This
'Pathfinder' (what an excellent name for an American
journal!) I also owe to you, with the summing up of your
performances in it, and with a notice of Mr. Browning's
'Blot on the Scutcheon,' which would make one poet
furious (the 'infelix Talfourd') and another a little
melancholy&mdash;namely, Mr. Browning himself. There is truth on
both sides, but it seems to me hard truth on Browning. I
do assure you I never saw him in my life&mdash;do not know
him even by correspondence&mdash;and yet, whether through
fellow-feeling for Eleusinian mysteries, or whether through
the more generous motive of appreciation of his powers, I
am very sensitive to the thousand and one stripes with
which the assembly of critics doth expound its vocation
over him, and the 'Athenaeum,' for instance, made me quite
cross and misanthropical last week.<a name="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> The truth is&mdash;and the
world should know the truth&mdash;it is easier to find a more
faultless writer than a poet of equal genius. Don't let us
fall into the category of the sons of Noah. Noah was once
drunk, indeed, but once he built the ark. Talking of poets,
would your 'Graham's Miscellany' care at all to have
occasional poetical contributions from Mr. Horne? I am
in correspondence with him, and I think I could manage
an arrangement upon the same terms as my engagement
rests on, if you please and your friends please, that is, and
without formality, if it should give you any pleasure. He
is a writer of great power, I think. And this reminds me
that you may be looking all the while for the 'Athenaeum's'
reply to your friend's proposition&mdash;of which I lost no time
in apprising the editor, Mr. Dilke, and here are some of
his words: 'An American friend who had been long
in England, and often conversed with me on the subject,
resolved on his return to establish such a correspondence.
In all things worth knowing&mdash;all reviews of good books'
(which 'are published first or simultaneously,' says Mr.
Dilke, 'in London'), 'he was anticipated, and after
some months he was driven of necessity to geological
surveys, centenary celebrations, progress of railroads, manufactures,
&amp;c., and thus the prospect was abandoned altogether.'
Having made this experiment, Mr. Dilke is unwilling
to risk another. Neither must we blame him for
the reserve. When the international copyright shall at once
protect the national <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> in literature and give
it additional fullness and value, we shall cease to say
insolently to you that what we want of your books we will
get without your help, but as it is, the Mr. Dilkes of us
have nothing much more courteous to do. I wish I could
have been of any use to your friend&mdash;I have done what I
could. In regard to critical papers of mine, I would willingly
give myself up to you, seeing your good nature; but it is
the truth that I never published any prose papers at all
except the series on the Greek Christian poets and the other
series on the English poets in the 'Athenaeum' of last year,
and both of which you have probably seen. Afterwards I
threw up my brief and went back to my poetry, in which I
feel that I must do whatever I am equal to doing at all.
That life is short and art long appears to us more true
than usual when we lie all day long on a sofa and are
as frightened of the east wind as if it were a tiger. Life
is not only short, but uncertain, and art is not only
long, but absorbing. What have I to do with writing
'<i>scandal</i>' (as Mr. Jones would say) upon my neighbour's
work, when I have not finished my own? So I threw up
my brief into Mr. Dilke's hands, and went back to my
verses. Whenever I print another volume you shall have it,
if Messrs. Wiley and Putnam will convey it to you. How
can I send you, by the way, anything I may have to send
you? Why will you not, as a nation, embrace our great
penny post scheme, and hold our envelopes in all acceptation?
You do not know&mdash;cannot guess&mdash;what a wonderful
liberty our Rowland Hill has given to British spirits, and
how we '<i>flash</i> a thought' instead of 'wafting' it from our
extreme south to our extreme north, paying 'a penny for
our thought' and for the electricity included. I recommend
you our penny postage as the most successful revolution
since the 'glorious three days' of Paris.</p>

<p>And so, you made merry with my scorn of my
'Prometheus.' Believe me&mdash;believe me absolutely&mdash;I did
not strike that others might spare, but from an earnest
remorse. When you know me better, you will know, I hope,
that I am <i>true</i>, whether right or wrong, and you know
already that I am right in this thing, the only merit of the
translation being its closeness. Can I be of any use to you,
dear Mr. Mathews? When I can, make use of me. You
surprise and disappoint me in your sketch of the Boston
poet, for the letter he wrote to me struck me as frank and
honest. I wonder if he made any use of the verses I sent
him; and I wonder what I sent him&mdash;for I never made a
note of it, through negligence, and have quite forgotten.
Are you acquainted with Mrs. Sigourney? She has offended
us much by her exposition of Mrs. Southey's letter, and I
must say not without cause. I rejoice in the progress of
'Wakondah,' wishing the influences of mountain and river
to be great over him and in him. And so I will say the
'God bless you' your kindness cares to hear, and remain,</p>

<p>Sincerely and thankfully yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>My dear Cousin,&mdash;Here is my copyright for you, and
you will see that I have put 'word' instead of 'sound,' as
certainly the proper 'word.' Do let me thank you once
more for all the trouble and interest you have taken with
me and in me. Observe besides that I have altered the
title according to your unconscious suggestion, and made it
'The Dead Pan,' which is a far better name, I think, than
the repetition of the <i>refrain</i>.</p>

<p>But I spoil my exemplary docility so far, by confessing
that I don't like 'scornful children' half&mdash;no, not half
so well as my 'railing children,' although, to be sure, you
proved to me that the last was nigh upon nonsense. You
proved it&mdash;that is, you almost proved it, for don't we say&mdash;at
least, <i>mightn't</i> we say&mdash;'the thunder was silent'?
'<i>thunder</i>' involving the idea of noise, as much as 'railing
children' do. Consider this&mdash;I give it up to you.<a name="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p>I am ashamed to have kept Carlyle so long, but I quite
failed in trying to read him at my &quot;usual pace&mdash;he <i>won't</i> be
read quick. After all, and full of beauty and truth as that
book is, and strongly as it takes hold of my sympathies,
there is nothing new in it&mdash;not even a new Carlyleism,
which I do not say by way of blaming the book,
because the author of it might use words like the apostle's:
'To write the same things unto you, to me indeed is not
grievous, and to you it is safe.' The world being blind
and deaf and rather stupid, requires a reiteration of certain
uncongenial truths....</p>

<p>I observe that the <i>most questionable rhymes</i> are not

long already.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
May 3, 1843.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;If <i>you</i> promised (which you
did), <i>I</i> ought to have promised&mdash;and therefore we may ask
each other's pardon....</p>

<p>How is the dog? and how does dear Mr. Martin find
himself in Arcadia? Do we all stand in his recollection
like a species of fog, or a concentrated essence of brick
wall? How I wish&mdash;and since I said it aloud to you I
have often wished it over in a whisper&mdash;that you would
put away your romance, or cut it in two, and spend six
months of the year in London with us! Miss Mitford
believes that wishes, if wished hard enough, realise themselves,
but my experience has taught me a less cheerful
creed. Only if wishes <i>do</i> realise themselves!</p>

<p>Miss Mitford is at Bath, where she has spent one week
and is about to spend two, and then goes on her way into
Devonshire. She amused me so the other day by desiring
me to look at the date of Mr. Landor's poems in their first
edition, because she was sure that it must be fifty years
since, and she finds him at this 1843, the very Lothario of
Bath, enchanting the wives, making jealous the husbands,
and 'enjoying,' altogether, the worst of reputations. I
suggested that if she proved him to be seventy-five, as long
as he proved himself enchanting, it would do no manner of
good in the way of practical ethics; and that, besides, for her
to travel round the world to investigate gentlemen's ages
was invidious, and might be alarming as to the safe inscrutability
of ladies' ages. She is delighted with the <i>scenery of Bath</i>,
which certainly, take it altogether, marble
and mountains, is the most beautiful town I ever looked
upon. Cheltenham, I think, is a mere commonplace to it,
although the avenues are beautiful, to be sure....</p>

<p>Mrs. Southey complains that she has lost half her income
by her marriage, and her friend Mr. Landor is anxious
to persuade, by the means of intermediate friends, Sir
Robert Peel to grant her a pension. She is said to be
in London now, and has at least left Keswick for ever. It
is not likely that Wordsworth should come here this year,
which I am sorry for now, although I should certainly be
sorry if he did come. A happy state of contradiction, not
confined either to that particular movement or no-movement,
inasmuch as I was gratified by his sending me the poem
you saw, and yet read it with such extreme pain as to incapacitate
me from judging of it. Such stuff we are made of!</p>

<p>This is a long letter&mdash;and you are tired, I feel by
instinct!</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dearest Mrs. Martin. Give my
love to Mr. Martin, and think of me as</p>

<p>Your very affectionate,<br />
BA.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
May 9, 1843 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I thank you much for the
copies of your 'Anti-Puseyistic Pugilism.' The papers
reached my hands quite safely and so missed setting the
world on fire; and I shall be as wary of them evermore
(be sure) as if they were gunpowder. Pray send them to
Mary Hunter. Why not? Why should you think that I
was likely to 'object' to your doing so? She will laugh.
<i>I</i> laughed, albeit in no smiling mood; for I have been
transmigrating from one room to another, and your packet
found me half tired and half excited, and <i>whole</i> grave. But
I could not choose but laugh at your Oxford charge; and
when I had counted your great guns and javelin points and
other military appurtenances of the Punic war, I said to
myself&mdash;or to Flush, 'Well, Mr. Boyd will soon be back
again with the dissenters.' Upon which I think Flush
said, 'That's a comfort.'</p>

<p>Mary's direction is, 111 London Road, Brighton. You
ought to send the verses to her yourself, if you mean to
please her entirely: and I cannot agree with you that there
is the slightest danger in sending them by the post. Letters
are never opened, unless you tempt the flesh by putting
sovereigns, or shillings, or other metallic substances inside
the envelope; and if the devil entered into me causing me
to write a libel against the Queen, I would send it by the
post fearlessly from John o' Groat's to Land's End inclusive.</p>

<p>Your very affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
May 14, 1843.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I hear with wonder from Arabel
of your repudiation of my word 'octosyllabic' for the two
lines in your controversial poem. Certainly, if you count
the syllables on your fingers, there are ten syllables in each
line: of <i>that</i> I am perfectly aware; but the lines are none
the less belonging to the species of versification called
octosyllabic. Do you not observe, my dearest Mr. Boyd,
that the final accent and rhyme fall on the eighth syllable
instead of the tenth, and that <i>that</i> single circumstance
determines the class of verse&mdash;that they are in fact octosyllabic
verses with triple rhymes?</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Hatching succession apostolical,<br />
With other falsehoods diabolical.<br />
</div>

<p>Pope has double rhymes in his heroic verses, but how does
he manage them? Why, he admits eleven syllables, throwing
the final accent and rhyme on the tenth, thus:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Worth makes the man, and want of it the f<i>e</i>llow,<br />
The rest is nought but leather and prun<i>e</i>lla.<br />
</div>

<p>Again, if there is a double rhyme to an octosyllabic verse,
there are always <i>nine</i> syllables in that verse, the final accent
and rhyme falling on the eighth syllable, thus:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Compound for sins that we're incl<i>i</i>ned to,<br />
By damning those we have no m<i>i</i>nd to.<br />
</div>

<p>('Hudibras.')</p>

<p>Again, if there is a triple rhyme to an octosyllabic verse
(precisely the present case) there must always be ten syllables
in that verse, the final accent and rhyme falling on the
eighth syllable; thus from 'Hudibras' again:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Then in their robes the penit<i>e</i>ntials<br />
Are straight presented with cred<i>e</i>ntials.<br />
Remember how in arms and p<i>o</i>litics,<br />
We still have worsted all your h<i>o</i>ly tricks.<br />
</div>

<p>You will admit that these last couplets are precisely of the
same structure as yours, and certainly they are octosyllabics,
and made use of by Butler in an octosyllabic poem, whereas
yours, to be rendered of the heroic structure, should run
thus:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Hatching at ease succession apostolical,<br />
With many other falsehoods diabolical.<br />
</div>

<p>I have written a good deal about an oversight on your part
of little consequence; but as you charged me with a mistake
made in cold blood and under corrupt influences from
Lake-mists, why I was determined to make the matter clear
to you. And as to the <i>influences</i>, if I were guilty of
this mistake, or of a thousand mistakes, Wordsworth would
not be guilty <i>in</i> me. I think of him now, exactly as I
thought of him during the first years of my friendship for
you, only with <i>an equal</i> admiration. He was a great
poet to me always, and always, while I have a soul for
poetry, will be so; yet I said, and say in an under-voice,
but steadfastly, that Coleridge was the grander genius.
There is scarcely anything newer in my estimation of
Wordsworth than in the colour of my eyes!</p>

<p>Perhaps I was wrong in saying '<i>a pun.</i>' But I thought
I apprehended a double sense in your application of the
term 'Apostolical succession' to Oxford's 'breeding' and
'hatching,' words which imply succession in a way unecclesiastical.</p>

<p>After all which quarrelling, I am delighted to have to
talk of your coming nearer to me&mdash;within reach&mdash;almost
within my reach. Now if I am able to go in a
carriage at all this summer, it will be hard but that I manage
to get across the park and serenade you in Greek under
your window.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
May 18, 1843.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;Yes, you have surprised me!</p>

<p>I always have thought of you, and I always think and
say, that you are truthful and candid in a supreme degree,
and therefore it is not your candour about Wordsworth
which surprises me.</p>

<p>He had the kindness to send me the poem upon Grace
Darling when it first appeared; and with a curious mixture
of feelings (for I was much gratified by his attention in
sending it) I yet read it with <i>so</i> much pain from the nature
of the subject, that my judgment was scarcely free to consider
the poetry&mdash;I could scarcely determine to myself what
I <i>thought</i> of it from feeling too much.</p>

<p><i>But</i> I do confess to you, my dear friend, that I
suspect&mdash;through the mist of my sensations&mdash;the poem in
question to be very inferior to his former poems; I confess
that the impression left on my mind is, of its decided
inferiority, and I have heard that the poet's friends and
critics (all except <i>one</i>) are mourning over its appearance;
sighing inwardly, 'Wordsworth is old.'</p>

<p>One thing is clear to me, however, and over <i>that</i> I
rejoice and triumph greatly. If you can esteem this poem
of 'Grace Darling,' you must be susceptible to the grandeur
and beauty of the poems which preceded it; and the cause
of your past reluctance to recognise the poet's power must
be, as I have always suspected, from your having given a
very partial attention and consideration to his poetry. You
were partial in your attention <i>I</i>, perhaps, was injudicious in
my extracts; but with your truth and his genius, I cannot
doubt but that the time will come for your mutual amity.
Oh that I could stand as a herald of peace, with my wool-twisted
fillet! I do not understand the Greek metres as
well as you do, but I understand Wordsworth's genius
better, and do you forgive that it should console me.</p>

<p>I will ask about his collegian extraction. Such a question
never occurred to me. Apollo taught him under the laurels,
while all the Muses looked through the boughs.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT,</p>

<p>Oh, yes, it delights me that you should be nearer. Of
course you know that Wordsworth is Laureate.<a name="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
May 19, 1843,<br />

<p>Thank you, my dear cousin, for all your kindness to me.
There is ivy enough for a thyrsus, and I almost feel ready
to enact a sort of Bacchus triumphalis 'for jollitie,' as I
see it already planted, and looking in at me through the
window. I never thought to see such a sight as <i>that</i> in my
London room, and am overwhelmed with my own glory.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Browning's note! Unless you say 'nay'
to me, I shall keep this note, which has pleased me so much,
yet not more than it ought. <i>Now</i>, I forgive Mr. Merivale
for his hard thoughts of my easy rhymes. But all this
pleasure, my dear Mr. Kenyon, I owe to <i>you</i>, and shall
remember that I do.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
May 26, 1843.<br />

<p>... I thank you for your part in the gaining of my bed,
dearest Mrs. Martin, most earnestly; and am quite ready to
believe that it was gained by <i>wishdom</i>, which believing is
wisdom! No, you would certainly never recognise my
prison if you were to see it. The bed, like a sofa and no
Bed; the large table placed out in the room, towards the
wardrobe end of it; the sofa rolled where a sofa should be
rolled&mdash;opposite the arm-chair: the drawers crowned with
a coronal of shelves fashioned by Sette and Co. (of papered
deal and crimson merino) to carry my books; the washing
table opposite turned into a cabinet with another coronal of
shelves; and Chaucer's and Homer's busts in guard over
these two departments of English and Greek poetry; three
more busts consecrating the wardrobe which there was no
annihilating; and the window&mdash;oh, I must take a new
paragraph for the window, I am out of breath.</p>

<p>In the window is fixed a deep box full of soil, where are
<i>springing up</i> my scarlet runners, nasturtiums, and
convolvuluses, although they were disturbed a few days ago by
the revolutionary insertion among them of a great ivy root with
trailing branches so long and wide that the top tendrils are
fastened to Henrietta's window of the higher storey, while
the lower ones cover all my panes. It is Mr. Kenyon's gift.
He makes the like to flourish out of mere flowerpots, and
embower his balconies and windows, and why shouldn't this
flourish with me? But certainly&mdash;there is no shutting
my eyes to the fact that it does droop a little. Papa
prophesies hard things against it every morning, 'Why, Ba,
it looks worse and worse,' and everybody preaches despondency.
I, however, persist in being sanguine, looking out
for new shoots, and making a sure pleasure in the meanwhile
by listening to the sound of the leaves against the pane, as
the wind lifts them and lets them fall. Well, what do you
think of my ivy? Ask Mr. Martin, if he isn't jealous
already.</p>

<p>Have you read 'The Neighbours,' Mary Howitt's translation
of Frederica Bremer's Swedish? Yes, perhaps.
Have you read 'The Home,' fresh from the same springs?
<i>Do</i>, if you have not. It has not only charmed me, but
made me happier and better: it is fuller of Christianity
than the most orthodox controversy in Christendom; and
represents to my perception or imagination a perfect and
beautiful embodiment of Christian outward life from the
inward, purely and tenderly. At the same time, I should
tell you that Sette says, 'I might have liked it ten years
ago, but it is too young and silly to give me any pleasure
now.' For <i>me</i>, however, it is not too young, and perhaps
it won't be for you and Mr. Martin. As to Sette, he is
among the patriarchs, to say nothing of the lawyers&mdash;and
there we leave him....</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street:<br />
Wednesday, or is it Thursday? [summer 1843].<br />

<p>My dear Cousin,&mdash;... I send you my friend Mr. Horne's
new epic,<a name="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> and beg you, if you have an opportunity, to drop
it at Mr. Eagles' feet, so that he may pick it up and look
at it. I have not gone through it (I have another copy),
but it appears to me to be full of fine things. As to the
author's fantasy of selling it for a farthing, I do not enter
into the secret of it&mdash;unless, indeed, he should intend
a sarcasm on the age's generous patronage of poetry,
which is possible.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
June 30, 1843.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dear Mr. Kenyon, for the Camden
Society books, and also for these which I return; and also
for the hope of seeing you, which I kept through yesterday.
I honor Mrs. Coleridge for the readiness of reasoning and
integrity in reasoning, for the learning, energy, and
impartiality which she has brought to her purpose, and I
agree with her in many of her objects; and disagree, by
opposing her opponents with a fuller front than she is
always inclined to do. In truth, I can never see anything
in these sacramental ordinances except a prospective sign
in one (Baptism), and a memorial sign in the other,
the Lord's Supper, and could not recognise either under
any modification as a peculiar instrument of grace, mystery,
or the like. The tendencies we have towards making
mysteries of God's simplicities are as marked and sure
as our missing the actual mystery upon occasion. God's
love is the true mystery, and the sacraments are only too
simple for us to understand. So you see I have read the
book in spite of prophecies. After all I should like to
cut it in two&mdash;it would be better for being shorter&mdash;and
it might be clearer also. There is, in fact, some dullness
and perplexity&mdash;a few passages which are, to my impression,
contradictory of the general purpose&mdash;something
which is not generous, about nonconformity&mdash;and what
I cannot help considering a superfluous tenderness for
Puseyism. Moreover she is certainly wrong in imagining
that the ante-Nicene fathers did not as a body teach
regeneration by baptism&mdash;even Gregory Nazianzen, the most
spiritual of many, did, and in the fourth century. But,
after all, as a work of theological controversy it is very
un-bitter and well-poised, gentle, and modest, and as the
work of a woman <i>you</i> must admire it and <i>we</i> be proud of
it&mdash;<i>that</i> remains certain at last.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Haydon! I am so sorry for his reverse in the
cartoons.<a name="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> It is a thunderbolt to him. I wonder, in the
pauses of my regret, whether Mr. Selous is <i>your</i> friend&mdash;whether
'Boadicea visiting the Druids,' suggested by you,
I think, as a subject, is this victorious 'Boadicea' down
for a hundred pound prize? You will tell me when you
come.</p>

<p>I have just heard an uncertain rumour of the arrival
of your brother. If it is not all air, I congratulate you
heartily upon a happiness only not past my appreciation.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>I send the copy of 'Orion' for <i>yourself</i>, which you asked
for. It is in the fourth edition.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
July 8, 1843.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dearest Mrs. Martin, for your kind sign
of interest in the questioning note, although I will not
praise the <i>stenography</i> of it. I shall be as brief to-day
as you, not quite out of revenge, but because I have
been writing to George and am the less prone to activities
from having caught cold in an inscrutable manner,
and being stiff and sore from head to foot and inclined to
be a little feverish and irritable of nerves. No, it is not
of the slightest consequence; I tell you the truth. But I
would have written to you the day before yesterday if it
had not been for this something between cramp and
rheumatism, which was rather unbearable at first, but
yesterday was better, and is to-day better than better, and
to-morrow will leave me quite well, if I may prophesy. I
only mention it lest you should have upbraided me for
not answering your note in a moment, as it deserved to be
answered. So don't put any nonsense into Georgie's head&mdash;forgive
me for beseeching you! I have been very well&mdash;downstairs
seven or eight times; lying on the floor in Papa's room;
meditating <i>the chair</i>, which would have amounted to
more than a meditation except for this little contrariety.
In a day or two more, if this cool warmth perseveres in serving
me, and no Ariel refills me 'with aches,' I shall fulfil your kind
wishes perhaps and be out&mdash;and so, no more about me!...</p>

<p>Oh, I do believe you think me a Cockney&mdash;a
metropolitan barbarian! But I persist in seeing no merit
and no superior innocence in being shut up even in
precincts of rose-trees, away from those great sources of
human sympathy and occasions of mental elevation and
instruction without which many natures grow narrow,
many others gloomy, and perhaps, if the truth were
known, very few prosper entirely, lit is not that I, who
have always lived a good deal in solitude and live in it still
more now, and love the country even painfully in my
recollections of it, would decry either one or the other&mdash;solitude
is most effective in a contrast, and if you do
not break the bark you cannot bud the tree, and, in short
(not to be <i>in long</i>), I could write a dissertation, which I will
spare you, 'about it and about it.' ...</p>

<p>Tell George to lend you&mdash;nay, I think I will be
generous and let him give you, although the author
gave me the book&mdash;the copy of the new epic, 'Orion,'
which he has with him. You have probably observed
the advertisement, and are properly instructed that Mr.
Horne the poet, who has sold three editions already at a
farthing a copy, and is selling a fourth at a shilling, and is
about to sell a fifth at half a crown (on the precise principle
of the a&euml;rial machine&mdash;launching himself into popularity
by a first impulse on the people), is my unknown friend,
with whom I have corresponded these four years without
having seen his face. Do you remember the beech leaves
sent to me from Epping Forest? Yes, you must. Well,
the sender is the poet, and the poem I think a very noble
one, and I want you to think so too. So hereby I empower
you to take it away from George and keep it for my sake&mdash;if
you will!</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Martin was so kind as to come and see me as
you commanded, and I must tell you that I thought him
looking so better than well that I was more than commonly
glad to see him. Give my love to him, and join me in
as much metropolitan missionary zeal as will bring you
both to London for six months of the year. Oh, I wish
you would come! Not that it is necessary for <i>you</i>, but
that it will be <i>so</i> good for <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>My ivy is growing, and I have <i>green blinds</i>, against
which there is an outcry. They say that I do it out of
envy, and for the equalisation of complexions.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: August 1843.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;I thank you very much for the
kindness of your questioning, and am able to answer that
notwithstanding the, as it seems to you, fatal significance of
a woman's silence, I am alive enough to be sincerely grateful
for any degree of interest spent upon me. As to Flush,
he should thank you too, but at the present moment he is
quite absorbed in finding a cool place in this room to lie
down in, having sacrificed his usual favorite place at my
feet, his head upon them, oppressed by the torrid necessity
of a thermometer above 70. To Flopsy's acquaintance he
would aspire gladly, only hoping that Flopsy does not
'delight to bark and bite,' like dogs in general, because
if he does Flush would as soon be acquainted with a <i>cat</i>, he
says, for he does not pretend to be a hero. Poor Flush!
'the bright summer days on which I am ever likely to take
him out for a ramble over hill and meadow' are never likely
to shine! But he follows, or rather leaps into my wheeled
chair, and forswears merrier company even now, to be near
me. I am a good deal better, it is right to say, and look
forward to a possible prospect of being better still, though I
may be shut out from climbing the Brocken otherwise than
in a vision.</p>

<p>You will see by the length of the 'Legend'<a name="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> which I
send to you (in its only printed form) <i>why</i> I do not send it
to you in manuscript. Keep the book as long as you please.
My new volume is not yet in the press, but I am writing
more and more in a view to it, pleased with the thought that
some kind hands are already stretched out in welcome
and acceptance of what it may become. Not as idle as I
appear, I have also been writing some fugitive verses for
American magazines. This is my confession. Forgive
its tediousness, and believe me thankfully and very sincerely
yours,</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: September 2, 1843.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;Your letter comes to remind me
how much I ought to be ashamed of myself.... I received
the book in all safety, and read your kind words about my
'Rosary' with more grateful satisfaction than appears from
the evidence. It is great pleasure to me to have written for
such readers, and it is great hope to me to be able to write
for them. The transcription of the 'Rosary' is a compliment
which I never anticipated, or you should have had the manuscript
copy you asked for, although I have not a perfect one
in my hands. The poem is full of faults, as, indeed, all my
poems appear to myself to be when I look back upon them
instead of looking down. I hope to be worthier in poetry
some day of the generous appreciation which you and your
friends have paid me in advance.</p>

<p>Tennyson is a great poet, I think, and Browning, the
author of 'Paracelsus,' has to my mind very noble capabilities.
Do you know Mr. Horne's 'Orion,' the poem published for
a farthing, to the wonder of booksellers and bookbuyers who
could not understand 'the speculation in its eyes?' There
are very fine things in this poem, and altogether I recommend
it to your attention. But what is 'wanting' in
Tennyson? He can think, he can feel, and his language is
highly expressive, characteristic, and harmonious. I am
very fond of Tennyson. He makes me thrill sometimes to
the end of my fingers, as only a true great poet can.</p>

<p>You praise me kindly, and if, indeed, the considerations
you speak of could be true of me, I am not one who could
lament having 'learnt in suffering what I taught in song.'
In any case, working for the future and counting gladly on
those who are likely to consider any work of mine acceptable
to themselves, I shall be very sure not to forget my friends
at Enfield.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Westwood, I remain sincerely yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
September 4, 1843. Finished September 5.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin, ... I have had a great
gratification within this week or two in receiving a letter&mdash;nay,
two letters&mdash;from Miss Martineau, one of the last
strangers in the world from whom I had any right to expect
a kindness. Yet most kind, most touching in kindness,
were both of these letters, so much so that I was not far
from crying for pleasure as I read them. She is very
hopelessly ill, you are probably aware, at Tynemouth in
Northumberland, suffering agonies from internal cancer,
and conquering occasional repose by the strength of opium,
but 'almost forgetting' (to use her own words) 'to wish for
health, in the intense enjoyment of pleasures independent
of the body.' She sent me a little work of hers called
'Traditions of Palestine.' Her friends had hoped by the
stationary character of some symptoms that the disease was
suspended, but lately it is said to be gaining ground, and
the serenity and elevation of her mind are more and more
triumphantly evident as the bodily pangs thicken....</p>

<p>And now I am going to tell you what will surprise you,
if you do not know it already. Stormie and Georgie are
passing George's vacation on the Rhine. You are certainly
surprised if you did not know it. Papa signed and sealed
them away on the ground of its being good and refreshing
for both of them, and I was even mixed up a little with the
diplomacy of it, until I found <i>they were going</i>, and then it
was a hard, terrible struggle with me to be calm and see
them go. But <i>that</i> was childish, and when I had heard
from them at Ostend I grew more satisfied again, and
attained to think less of the fatal influences of <i>my star</i>.
They went away in great spirits, Stormie 'quite elated,' to
use his own words, and then at the end of the six weeks
they <i>must</i> be at home at Sessions; and no possible way of
passing the interim could be pleasanter and better and more
exhilarating for themselves. The plan was to go from
Ostend by railroad to Brussels and Cologne, then to pass
down the Rhine to Switzerland, spend a few days at Geneva,
and a week in Paris as they return. The only fear is that
Stormie won't go to Paris. We have too many friends there&mdash;a
strange obstacle.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin, I am doing something more than
writing you a letter, I think.</p>

<p>May God bless you all with the most enduring consolations!
Give my love to Mr. Martin, and believe also, both
of you, in my sympathy. I am glad that your poor Fanny
should be so supported. May God bless her and all of
you!</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin's affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>I am very well for <i>me</i>, and was out in the chair
yesterday.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
September 8, 1843.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I ask you humbly not to fancy
me in a passion whenever I happen to be silent. For a
woman to be silent is ominous, I know, but it need not be
significant of anything quite so terrible as ill-humour. And
yet it always happens so; if I do not write I am sure to be
cross in your opinion. You set me down directly as 'hurt,'
which means <i>irritable</i>; or 'offended,' which means <i>sulky</i>;
your ideal of me having, in fact, 'its finger in its eye' all day
long.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, humbled as I was by your hard
criticism of my soft rhymes about Flush,<a name="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> waited for Arabel
to carry a message for me, begging to know whether you
would care at all to see my 'Cry of the Children'<a name="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> before I
sent it to you. But Arabel went without telling me that
she was going: twice she went to St. John's Wood and made
no sign; and now I find myself thrown on my own resources.
Will you see the 'Cry of the Human'<a name="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> or not? It will not
please you, probably. It wants melody. The versification
is eccentric to the ear, and the subject (the factory miseries)
is scarcely an agreeable one to the fancy. Perhaps altogether
you had better not see it, because I know you think me
to be deteriorating, and I don't want you to have further
hypothetical evidence of so false an opinion. Humbled as
I am, I say 'so false an opinion.' Frankly, if not humbly,
I believe myself to have gained power since the time of the
publication of the 'Seraphim,' and lost nothing except happiness.
Frankly, if not humbly!</p>

<p>With regard to the 'House of Clouds'<a name="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> I disagree both
with you and Miss Mitford, thinking it, comparatively with
my other poems, neither so bad nor so good as you two
account it. It has certainly been singled out for great
praise both at home and abroad, and only the other day
Mr. Horne wrote to me to reproach me for not having
mentioned it to him, because he came upon it accidentally
and considered it 'one of my best productions.' Mr.
Kenyon holds the same opinion. As for Flush's verses,
they are what I call cobweb verses, thin and light enough;
and Arabel was mistaken in telling you that Miss Mitford
gave the prize to them. Her words were, 'They are as
tender and true as anything you ever wrote, but nothing is
equal to the &quot;House of Clouds.&quot;' Those were her words,
or to that effect, and I refer to them to you, not for the sake
of Flush's verses, which really do not appear even to myself,
their writer, worth a defence, but for the sake of <i>your</i> judgment
of <i>her</i> accuracy in judging.</p>

<p>Lately I have received two letters from the profoundest
woman thinker in England, Miss Martineau&mdash;letters which
touched me deeply while they gave me pleasure I did not
expect.</p>

<p>My poor Flush has fallen into tribulation. Think of
Catiline, the great savage Cuba bloodhound belonging to
this house, attempting last night to worry him just as the
first Catiline did Cicero. Flush was rescued, but not before
he had been wounded severely: and this morning he is on
three legs and in great depression of spirits. My poor, poor
Flushie! He lies on my sofa and looks up to me with most
pathetic eyes.</p>

<p>Where is Annie? If I send my love to her, will it ever
be found again?</p>

May God bless you both!<br />

<p>Dearest Mr. Boyd's affectionate and grateful<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Monday, September 19, 1843.<br />

<p>My own dear Friend,&mdash;I should have written instantly
to explain myself out of appearances which did me injustice,
only I have been in such distress as to have no courage for
writing. Flush was stolen away, and for three days I could
neither sleep nor eat, nor do anything much more rational
than cry. <i>Confiteor tibi</i>, oh reverend father. And if you
call me very silly, I am so used to the reproach throughout
the week as to be hardened to the point of vanity. The
worst of it is, now, that there will be no need of more
'Houses of Clouds' to prove to you the deterioration of my
faculties. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>In my own defence, I really believe that my distress
arose somewhat less from the mere separation from dear
little Flushie than from the consideration of how he was
breaking his heart, cast upon the cruel world. Formerly,
when he has been prevented from sleeping on my bed he
has passed the night in moaning piteously, and often he has
refused to eat from a strange hand. And then he loves me,
heart to heart; there was no exaggeration in my verses about
him, if there was no poetry. And when I heard that he cried
in the street and then vanished, there was little wonder that
I, on my part, should cry in the house.</p>

<p>With great difficulty we hunted the dog-banditti into
their caves of the city, and bribed them into giving back
their victim. Money was the least thing to think of in
such case; I would have given a thousand pounds if I had
had them in my hand. The audacity of the wretched men
was marvellous. They said that they had been 'about
stealing Flush these two years,' and warned us plainly to
take care of him for the future.</p>

<p>The joy of the meeting between Flush and me would be
a good subject for a Greek ode&mdash;I recommend it to you.
It might take rank next to the epical parting of Hector and
Andromache. He dashed up the stairs into my room and
into my arms, where I hugged him and kissed him, black
as he was&mdash;black as if imbued in a distillation of St. Giles's.
Ah, I can break jests about it <i>now</i>, you see. Well, to go
back to the explanations I promised to give you, I must tell
you that Arabel <i>perfectly forgot</i> to say a word to me about
'Blackwood' and your wish that I should send the magazine.
It was only after I heard that you had procured it yourself,
and after I mentioned this to her, that she remembered her
omission all at once. Therefore I am quite vexed and
disappointed, I beg you to believe&mdash;<i>I</i>, who have pleasure
in giving you any printed verses of mine that you care to have.
Never mind! I may print another volume before long, and
lay it at your feet. In the meantime, you <i>endure</i> my 'Cry of
the Children' better than I had anticipated&mdash;just because I
never anticipated your being able to read it to the end, and was
over-delicate of placing it in your hands on that very account.
My dearest Mr. Boyd, you are right in your complaint against
the rhythm. The first stanza came into my head in a hurricane,
and I was obliged to make the other stanzas like it&mdash;<i>that</i>
is the whole mystery of the iniquity. If you look Mr. Lucas
from head to foot, you will never find such a rhythm on his
person. The whole crime of the versification belongs to
<i>me</i>. So blame <i>me</i>, and by no means another poet, and I
will humbly confess that I deserve to be blamed in some
<i>measure</i>. There is a roughness, my own ear being witness,
and I give up the body of my criminal to the rod of your
castigation, kissing the last as if it were Flush.</p>

<p>A report runs in London that Mr. Boyd says of
Elizabeth Barrett: 'She is a person of the most perverted
judgment in England.' Now, if this be true, I shall not
mend my evil position in your opinion, my very dear friend,
by confessing that I differ with you, the more the longer I
live, on the ground of what you call 'jumping lines.' I am
speaking not of particular cases, but of the principle, the
general principle, of these cases, and the tenacity of my
judgment does not arise from the teaching of 'Mr. Lucas,'
but from the deeper study of the old master-poets&mdash;English
poets&mdash;those of the Elizabeth and James ages, before the
corruption of French rhythms stole in with Waller and
Denham, and was acclimated into a national inodorousness
by Dryden and Pope. We differ so much upon this subject
that we must proceed by agreeing to differ, and end, perhaps,
by finding it agreeable to differ; there can be no possible
use in an argument. Only you must be upright in justice,
and find Wordsworth innocent of misleading me. So far
from having read him more within these three years, I have
read him <i>less</i>, and have taken no new review, I do assure
you, of his position and character as a poet, and these facts
are testified unto by the other fact that my poetry, neither
in its best features nor its worst, is adjusted after the fashion
of his school.</p>

<p>But I am writing too much; you will have no patience
with me. 'The Excursion' is accused of being lengthy,
and so you will tell me that I convict myself of plagiarism,
<i>currente calamo</i>.</p>

<p>I have just finished a poem of some eight hundred
lines, called 'The Vision of Poets,'<a name="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> philosophical,
allegorical&mdash;anything but popular. It is in stanzas, every one
an octosyllabic triplet, which you will think odd, and I
have not <i>sanguinity</i> enough to defend.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dearest Mr. Boyd! Yes, I
heard&mdash;I was glad to hear&mdash;of your having resumed that
which used to be so great a pleasure to you&mdash;Miss Marcus's
society. I remain,</p>

<p>Affectionately and gratefully yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>My love to dear Annie.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
October 1843.<br />

<p>You are probably right in respect to Tennyson, for
whom, with all my admiration of him, I would willingly
secure more exaltation and a broader clasping of truth.
Still, it is not possible to have so much beauty without a
certain portion of truth, the position of the Utilitarians being
true in the inverse. But I think as I did of 'uses' and
'responsibilities,' and do hold that the poet is a preacher
and must look to his doctrine.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Tennyson will grow more solemn, like the
sun, as his day goes on. In the meantime we have the
noble 'Two Voices,' and, among other grand intimations of a
teaching power, certain stanzas to J.K. (I think the initials
are) on the death of his brother,<a name="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> which very deeply affected
me.</p>

<p>Take away the last stanzas, which should be applied
more definitely to the <i>body</i>, or cut away altogether as a lie
against eternal verity, and the poem stands as one of the
finest of monodies. The nature of human grief never surely
was more tenderly intimated or touched&mdash;it brought tears
to my eyes. Do read it. He is not a Christian poet, up to
this time, but let us listen and hear his next songs. He is
one of God's singers, whether he knows it or does not
know it.</p>

<p>I am thinking, lifting up my pen, what I can write to
you which is likely to be interesting to you. After all I
come to chaos and silence, and even old night&mdash;it is
growing so dark. I live in London, to be sure, and except for
the glory of it I might live in a desert, so profound is my
solitude and so complete my isolation from things and
persons without. I lie all day, and day after day, on the
sofa, and my windows do not even look into the street.
To abuse myself with a vain deceit of rural life I have had
ivy planted in a box, and it has flourished and spread over
one window, and strikes against the glass with a little stroke
from the thicker leaves when the wind blows at all briskly.
<i>Then</i> I think of forests and groves; it is my triumph when
the leaves strike the window pane, and this is not a sound
like a lament. Books and thoughts and dreams (almost
too consciously <i>dreamed</i>, however, for me&mdash;the illusion of
them has almost passed) and domestic tenderness can and
ought to leave nobody lamenting. Also God's wisdom,
deeply steeped in His love, <i>is</i> as far as we can stretch out
our hands.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: December 26, 1843.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;You think me, perhaps, and not
without apparent reason, ungrateful and insensible to your
letter, but indeed I am neither one nor the other, and I
am writing now to try and prove it to you. I was much
touched by some tones of kindness in the letter, and it was
welcome altogether, and I did not need the 'owl' which
came after to waken me, because I was wide awake enough
from the first moment; and now I see that you have been
telling your beads, while I seemed to be telling nothing, in
that dread silence of mine. May all true saints of poetry
be propitious to the wearer of the 'Rosary.'</p>

<p>In answer to a question which you put to me long ago
on the subject of books of theology, I will confess to you
that, although I have read rather widely the divinity of the
Greek Fathers, Gregory, Chrysostom, and so forth, and
have of course informed myself in the works generally of
our old English divines, Hooker, Jeremy Taylor, and so
forth, I am not by any means a frequent reader of books of
theology as such, and as the men of our times have made
them. I have looked into the 'Tracts' from curiosity and
to hear what the world was talking of, and I was disappointed
<i>even</i> in the degree of intellectual power displayed
in them. From motives of a desire of theological instruction
I very seldom read any book except God's own. The
minds of persons are differently constituted; and it is no
praise to mine to admit that I am apt to receive less of
what is called edification from human discourses on divine
subjects, than disturbance and hindrance. I read the
Scriptures every day, and in as simple a spirit as I can;
thinking as little as possible of the controversies engendered
in that great sunshine, and as much as possible of the heat
and glory belonging to it. It is a sure fact in my eyes that
we do not require so much <i>more knowledge</i>, as a stronger
apprehension, by the faith and affections, of what we already
know.</p>

<p>You will be sorry to hear that Mr. Tennyson is not well,
although his friends talk of nervousness, and do not fear
much ultimate mischief....<a name="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p>It is such a lovely <i>May</i> day, that I am afraid of breaking
the spell by writing down Christmas wishes.</p>

<p>Very faithfully yours,<br />
ELIZABETH BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: December 31, 1843.<br />

<p>If you do find the paper I was invited to write upon
Wordsworth<a name="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>, you will see to which class of your admiring
or abhorring friends I belong. Perhaps you will cry out
quickly, 'To the blind admirers, certes.' And I have a
high admiration of Wordsworth. His spirit has worked a
good work, and has freed into the capacity of work other
noble spirits. He took the initiative in a great poetic
movement, and is not only to be praised for what he has
done, but for what he has helped his age to do. For the
rest, Byron has more passion and intensity, Shelley more
fancy and music, Coleridge could see further into the
unseen, and not one of those poets has insulted his own
genius by the production of whole poems, such as I could
name of Wordsworth's, the vulgarity of which is childish,
and the childishness vulgar. Still, the wings of his genius
are wide enough to cast a shadow over its feet, and our
gratitude should be stronger than our critical acumen. Yes,
I <i>will</i> be a blind admirer of Wordsworth's. I <i>will</i> shut my
eyes and be blind. Better so, than see too well for the
thankfulness which is his due from me....</p>

<p>Yes, I mean to print as much as I can find and make
room for, 'Brown Rosary' and all. I am glad you liked
'Napoleon,'<a name="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> but I shall be more glad if you decide when
you see this new book that I have made some general
progress in strength and expression. Sometimes I rise into
hoping that I may have done so, or may do so still more.</p>

<p>The poet's work is no light work. His wheat will not
grow without labour any more than other kinds of wheat,
and the sweat of the spirit's brow is wrung by a yet harder
necessity. And, thinking so, I am inclined to a little regret
that you should have hastened your book even for the sake
of a sentiment. Now you will be angry with me....</p>

<p>There are certain difficulties in the way of the critic
unprofessional, as I know by experience. Our most sweet
voices are scarcely admissible among the most sour ones
of the regular brotherhood....</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau is quite well,'trudging miles together
in the snow,' when the snow was, and in great spirits.
Wordsworth is to be in London in the spring. Tennyson
is dancing the polka and smoking cloud upon cloud at
Cheltenham. Robert Browning is meditating a new poem,
and an excursion on the Continent. Miss Mitford came to
spend a day with me some ten days ago; sprinkled, as to
the soul, with meadow dews. Am I at the end of my
account? I think so.</p>

<p>Did you read 'Blackwood'? and in that case have you
had deep delight in an exquisite paper by the Opium-eater,
which my heart trembled through from end to end? What
a poet that man is! how he vivifies words, or deepens them,
and gives them profound significance....</p>

<p>I understand that poor Hood is supposed to be dying,
really dying, at last. Sydney Smith's last laugh mixes
with his, or nearly so. But Hood had a deeper heart, in
one sense, than Sydney Smith, and is the material of a
greater man.</p>

<p>And what are you doing? Writing&mdash;reading&mdash;or
musing of either? Are you a reviewer-man&mdash;in opposition
to the writer? Once, reviewing was my besetting sin, but
now it is only my frailty. Now that I lie here at the mercy
of every reviewer, I save myself by an instinct of
self-preservation from that 'gnawing tooth' (as Homer and
Aeschylus did rightly call it), and spring forward into definite
work and thought. Else, I should perish. Do you understand
that? If you are a reviewer-man you will, and if not,
you must set it down among those mysteries of mine which
people talk of as profane.</p>

<p>May God bless you, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />

[Undated.]<br />

<p>You know as well as I do how the plague of rhymers,
and of bad rhymes, is upon the land, and it was only three
weeks ago that, at a 'Literary Institute' at Brighton, I heard
of the Reverend somebody Stoddart gravely proposing
'Poetry for the Million' to his audience; he assuring them
that 'poets made a mystery of their art,' but that in fact
nothing except an English grammar, and a rhyming
dictionary, and some instruction about counting on the
fingers, was necessary in order to make a poet of any man!</p>

<p><i>This</i> is a fact. And to this extent has the art, once
called divine, been desecrated among the educated classes
of our country.</p>

<p>Very sincerely yours,<br />

<br /><br />
<p>Besides the poems, to which reference has been made in
the above letters, Miss Barrett was engaged, during the year
1843, in co-operating with her friend Mr. Home in the production
of his great critical enterprise, 'The New Spirit of
the Age.' In this the much daring author undertook no
less a task than that of passing a sober and serious judgment
on his principal living comrades in the world of letters.
Not unnaturally he ended by bringing a hornets' nest about
his ears&mdash;alike of those who thought they should have been
mentioned and were not, and of those who were mentioned
but in terms which did not satisfy the good opinion of themselves
with which Providence had been pleased to gift
them. The volumes appeared under Home's name alone,
and he took the whole responsibility; but he invited
assistance from others, and in particular used the collaboration
of Miss Barrett to no small extent. She did not indeed
contribute any complete essay to his work; but she
expressed her opinion, when invited, on several writers, in a
series of elaborate letters, which were subsequently worked
up by Home into his own criticisms.<a name="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> The secret of her cooperation
was carefully kept, and she does not appear to
have suffered any of the evil consequences of his indiscretions,
real or imagined. Another contribution from her
consisted of the suggestion of mottoes appropriate to each
writer noticed at length; and in this work she had an unknown
collaborator in the person of Robert Browning. So
ends the somewhat uneventful year of 1843.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>The year 1844 marks an important epoch in the life of
Mrs. Browning. It was in this year that, as a result of the
publication of her two volumes of 'Poems,' she won her
general and popular recognition as a poetess whose rank
was with the foremost of living writers. It was six years
since she had published a volume of verse; and in the
meanwhile she had been gaining strength and literary
experience. She had tried her wings in the pages of
popular periodicals. She had profited by the criticisms on
her earlier work, and by intercourse with men of letters;
and though her defects in literary art were by no means
purged away, yet the flights of her inspiration were stronger
and more assured. The result is that, although the volumes
of 1844 do not contain absolutely her best work&mdash;no one
with the 'Sonnets from the Portuguese' in his mind can
affirm so much as that&mdash;they contain that which has been
most generally popular, and which won her the position which
for the rest of her life she held in popular estimation among
the leaders of English poetry.</p>

<p>The principal poem in these two volumes is the 'Drama
of Exile.' Of the genesis of this work, Miss Barrett gives the
following account in a letter to Home, dated December 28
1843:</p>

<blockquote><p>'A volume full of manuscripts had been ready for more
than a year, when suddenly, a short time ago, when I fancied I
had no heavier work than to make copy and corrections, I fell
upon a fragment of a sort of masque on &quot;The First Day's
Exile from Eden&quot;&mdash;or rather it fell upon me, and beset me
till I would finish it.'<a name="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At one time it was intended to use its name as the title
to the two volumes; but this design was abandoned, and
they appeared under the simple description of 'Poems, by
Elizabeth Barrett Barrett.' The 'Vision of Poets' comes
next in length to the 'Drama'; and among the shorter pieces
were several which rank among her best work, 'The Cry
of the Children,' 'Wine of Cyprus,' 'The Dead Pan,'
'Bertha in the Lane,' 'Crowned and Buried,' 'The Mourning
Mother,' and 'The Sleep,' together with such popular
favourites as 'Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' 'The Romaunt
of the Page,' and 'The Rhyme of the Duchess May.' Since
the publication of 'The Seraphim' volume, the new era of
poetry had developed itself to a notable extent. Tennyson
had published the best of his earlier verse, 'Locksley Hall,'
'Ulysses,' the 'Morte d'Arthur,' 'The Lotus Eaters,' 'A
Dream of Fair Women,' and many more; Browning had
issued his wonderful series of 'Bells and Pomegranates,'
including 'Pippa Passes,' 'King Victor and King Charles,'
'Dramatic Lyrics,' 'The Return of the Druses,' and 'The
Blot on the 'Scutcheon'; and it was among company such
as this that Miss Barrett, by general consent, now took her
place.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
January 8, 1844.<br />

<p>Thank you again and again, my dearest Mrs. Martin, for
your flowers, and the verses which gave them another
perfume. The 'incense of the heart' lost not a grain of its
perfume in coming so far, and not a leaf of the flowers was
ruffled, and to see such gorgeous colours all on a sudden at
Christmas time was like seeing a vision, and almost made
Flush and me rub our eyes. Thank you, dearest Mrs.
Martin; how kind of you! The grace of the verses and the
brightness of the flowers were too much for me altogether.
And when George exclaimed, 'Why, she has certainly laid
bare her greenhouse,' I had not a word to say in justification
of myself for being the cause of it.</p>

<p>Papa admired the branch of Australian origin so much
that he walked all over the house with it. Beautiful it
is indeed; but my eyes turn back to the camellias. I do
believe that I like to look at a camellia better than at a rose;
and then <i>these</i> have a double association....</p>

<p>I meant to write a long letter to you to-day, but Mr.
Kenyon has been to see me and cut my time short before
post time. You remember, perhaps, how his brother married
a German, and, after an exile of many years in Germany,
returned last summer to England to settle. Well, he can't
bear us any longer! His wife is growing paler and paler
with the pressure of English social habits, or rather unsocial
habits; and he himself is a German at heart; and besides,
being a man of a singularly generous nature, and accustomed
to give away in handfuls of silver and gold one-third
of every year's income, he dislikes the social obligation of
<i>spending</i> it here. So they are going back. Poor Mr.
Kenyon! I am full of sympathy with him. This returning
to England was a dream of all last year to him. He gave
up his house to the new comers, and bought a new one;
and talked of the brightness secured to his latter years by
the presence of his only remaining near relative; and I see
that, for all his effort towards a bright view of the matter,
he is disappointed&mdash;very. Should you suppose that four
hundred pounds in Vienna go as far as a thousand in
England? I should never have fancied it.</p>

<p>You shall hear from me, my dearest Mrs. Martin, in
another few days; and I send this as it is, just because I
am benighted by the post hour, and do not like to pass
your kindness with even one day's apparent neglect.</p>

<p>May God bless you and dear Mr. Martin. The kindest
wishes for the long slope of coming year, and for the many,
I trust, beyond it, belong to you from the deepest of our
hearts.</p>

<p>But shall you not be coming&mdash;setting out&mdash;very soon,
before I can write again?</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
[?January 1844.]<br />

<p>I am so sorry, dear Mr. Kenyon, to hear&mdash;which I did,
last night, for the first time&mdash;of your being unwell. I had
hoped that to-day would bring a better account, but your
note, with its next week prospect, is disappointing. The
'ignominy' would have been very preferable&mdash;to us, at least,
particularly as it need not have lasted beyond to-day, dear
Georgie being quite recovered, and at his law again, and no
more symptoms of small-pox in anybody. We should all
be well, if it were not for me and my cough, which is
better, but I am not quite well, nor have yet been out.</p>

<p>A letter came to me from dear Miss Mitford a few days
since, which I had hoped to talk to you about. Some of
the subject of it is Mr. Kenyon's '<i>only fault</i>,' which
ought, of course, to be a large one to weigh against the
multitudinous ones of other people, but which seems to be:
'He has the habit of walking in without giving notice. He
thinks it saves trouble, whereas in a small family, and at a
distance from a town, the effect is that one takes care to be
provided for the whole time that one expects him, and then,
by some exquisite ill luck, on the only day when one's
larder is empty, in he comes!' And so, if you have not
written to interrupt her in this process of indefinite expectation,
the 'only fault' will, in her eyes, grow, as it ought, as
large as fifty others.</p>

<p>I do hope, dear Mr. Kenyon, soon to hear that you are
better&mdash;and well&mdash;and that your course of prophecy may
not run smooth all through next week.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,<br />
E. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


Saturday.<br />
<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
Saturday night [about March 1844].<br />

<p>I return Mr. Burges's criticism, which I omitted to
talk to you of this morning, but which interested me much
in the reading. Do let him understand how obliged to him
I am for permitting me to look, for a moment, according to
his view of the question. Perhaps my poetical sense is not
convinced all through, and certainly my critical sense is not
worth convincing, but I am delighted to be able to call by
the name of Aeschylus, under the authority of Mr. Burges,
those noble electrical lines (electrical for double reasons)
which had struck me twenty times as Aeschylean, when I
read them among the recognised fragments of Sophocles.
You hear Aeschylus's footsteps and voice in the lines. No
other of the gods could tread so heavily, or speak so like
thundering.</p>

<p>I wrote all this to begin with, hesitating how else to
begin. My very dear and kind friend, you understand&mdash;do
you not?&mdash;through an expression which, whether written or
spoken, must remain imperfect, to what deep, full feeling
of gratitude your kindness has moved me.<a name="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> The good you
have done me, and just at the moment when I should have
failed altogether without it, and in more than one way, and
in a deeper than the obvious degree&mdash;all this I know better
than you do, and I thank you for it from the bottom of my
heart. I shall never forget it, as long as I live to remember
anything. The book may fail signally after all&mdash;<i>that</i> is
another question; but I shall not fail, to begin with, and
<i>that</i> I owe to <i>you</i>, for I was falling to pieces in
nerves and spirits when you came to help me. I had only enough
instinct left to be ashamed, a little, afterwards, of having
sent you, in company, too, with Miss Martineau's heroic
cheerfulness, that note of weak because unavailing complaint.
It was a long compressed feeling breaking suddenly
into words. Forgive and forget that I ever so troubled
you&mdash;no, 'troubled' is not the word for your kindness!&mdash;and
remember, as I shall do, the great good you have done me.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear cousin.</p>

<p>Affectionately yours always,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>This note is not to be answered.</p>

<p>I am thinking of writing to Moxon, as there does not
seem much to arrange. The type and size of Tennyson's
books seem, upon examination, to suit my purpose
excellently.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
March 21, 1844.<br />

<p>No, you never sent me back Miss Martineau's letter, my
dear cousin; but you will be sure, or rather Mr. Crabb
Robinson will, to find it in some too safe a place;
and then I shall have it. In the meantime here are
the other letters back again. You will think that I was
keeping them for a deposit, a security, till I 'had my
ain again,' but I have only been idle and busy together.
They are the most interesting that can be, and have
quite delighted me. By the way, <i>I</i>, who saw nothing to
object to in the 'Life in the Sick Room,' object very much
to her argument in behalf of it&mdash;an argument certainly
founded on a miserable misapprehension of the special
doctrine referred to in her letter. There is nothing so
elevating and ennobling to the nature and mind of man as
the view which represents it raised into communion with
God Himself, by the justification and purification of God
Himself. Plato's dream brushed by the gate of this doctrine
when it walked highest, and won for him the title of 'Divine.'
That it is vulgarised sometimes by narrow-minded teachers
in theory, and by hypocrites in action, might be an
argument (if admitted at all) against all truth, poetry, and
music!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I was glad to see the leaning on the
Education question; in which all my friends the Dissenters
did appear to me so painfully wrong and so unworthily wrong
at once.</p>

<p>And Southey's letters! I did quite delight in <i>them</i>!
They are more <i>personal</i> than any I ever saw of his; and
have more warm every-day life in them.</p>

<p>The particular Paul Pry in question (to come down to
<i>my</i> life) never 'intrudes.' It is his peculiarity. And I put
the stop exactly where I was bid; and was going to put
Gabriel's speech,<a name="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> only&mdash;with the pen in my hand to
do it&mdash;I found that the angel was a little too exclamatory
altogether, and that he had cried out, 'O ruined earth!' and
'O miserable angel!' just before, approaching to the habit of
a mere caller of names. So I altered the passage otherwise;
taking care of your full stop after 'despair.' Thank you, my
dear Mr. Kenyon.</p>

<p>Also I sent enough manuscript for the first sheet, and a
note to Moxon yesterday, last night, thanking him for
his courtesy about Leigh Hunt's poems; and following
your counsel in every point. 'Only last night,' you will
say! But I have had <i>such</i> a headache&mdash;and some very
painful vexation in the prospect of my maid's leaving me,
who has been with me throughout my illness; so that
I am much attached to her, with the best reasons for being
so, while the idea of a stranger is scarcely tolerable to me
under my actual circumstances.</p>

<p>The 'Palm Leaves'<a name="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> are full of strong thought and good
thought&mdash;thought expressed excellently well; but of poetry, in
the true sense, and of imagination in any, I think them bare
and cold&mdash;somewhat wintry leaves to come from the East,
surely, surely!</p>

<p>May the change of air be rapid in doing you good&mdash;the
weather seems to be softening on purpose for you. May
God bless you, dear Mr. Kenyon; I never can thank you
enough. When you return I shall be rustling my 'proofs'
about you, to prove my faith in your kindness.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
March 22, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I heard that once I wrote three
times too long a letter to you; I am aware that nine
times too long a silence is scarcely the way to make up
for it. Forgive me, however, as far as you can, for every
sort of fault. When I once begin to write to you, I do
not know how to stop; and I have had so much to do
lately as scarcely to know how to begin to write to you.
<i>Hence these</i> faults&mdash;not quite tears&mdash;in spite of my penitence
and the quotation.</p>

<p>At last my book is in the press. My great poem (in
the modest comparative sense), my 'Masque of Exile' (as
I call it at last<a name="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>), consists of some nineteen hundred or
two thousand lines, and I call it 'Masque of <i>Exile</i>' because
it refers to Lucifer's exile, and to that other mystical exile
of the Divine Being which was the means of the return
homewards of my Adam and Eve. After the exultation
of boldness of composition, I fell into one of my deepest
fits of despondency, and at last, at the end of most painful
vacillations, determined not to print it. Never was a
manuscript so near the fire as my 'Masque' was. I had
not even the instinct of applying for help to anybody.
In the midst of this Mr. Kenyon came in by accident,
and asked about my poem. I told him that I had given
it up, despairing of my republic. In the kindest way he
took it into his hands, and proposed to carry it home and
read it, and tell me his impression. 'You know,' he said,
'I have a prejudice against these sacred subjects for poetry,
but then I have another prejudice <i>for you</i>, and one may
neutralise the other.' The next day I had a letter from him
with the returned manuscript&mdash;a letter which I was absolutely
certain, before I opened it, would counsel <i>against</i> the
publication. On the contrary! His impression is clearly in
favour of the poem, and, while he makes sundry criticisms
on minor points, he considers it very superior as a whole to
anything I ever did before&mdash;more sustained, and fuller in
power. So my nerves are braced, and I grow a man again;
and the manuscript, as I told you, is in the press. Moreover,
you will be surprised to hear that I think of bringing
out <i>two volumes of poems</i> instead of one, by advice of Mr.
Moxon, the publisher. Also, the Americans have commanded
an American edition, to come out in numbers, either a little
before or simultaneously with the English one, and provided with
a separate preface for themselves.</p>

<p>There now! I have told you all this, knowing your
kindness, and that you will care to hear of it.</p>

<p>It has given me the greatest concern to hear of dear
Annie's illness, and I do hope, both for your sake and for
all our sakes, that we may have better news of her before
long.</p>

<p>But I don't mean to fall into another scrape to-day by
writing too much. May God bless you, my very dear
friend!</p>

<p>I am ever your affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
April I, 1844.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;Your kind letter I was delighted
to receive. You mistake a good deal the capacities in
judgment of 'the man.'<a name="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> The 'man' is highly refined in his
tastes, and leaning to the classical (I was going to say to
<i>your</i> classical, only suddenly I thought of Ossian) a good
deal more than I do. He has written satires in the manner
of Pope, which admirers of Pope have praised warmly and
deservedly. If I had hesitated about the conclusiveness of
his judgments, it would have been because of his confessed
indisposition towards subjects religious and ways mystical,
and his occasional insufficient indulgence for rhymes and
rhythms which he calls '<i>Barrettian</i>.' But these things
render his favourable inclination towards my 'Drama of
Exile' still more encouraging (as you will see) to my hopes
for it.</p>

<p>Still, I do tremble a good deal inwardly when I come to
think of what your own thoughts of my poem, and poems
in their two-volume development, may finally be. I am
afraid of you. You will tell me the truth as it appears to
you&mdash;upon <i>that</i> I may rely; and I should not wish you to
suppress a single disastrous thought for the sake of the
unpleasantness it may occasion to me. My own faith is
that I have made progress since 'The Seraphim,' only it is
too possible (as I confess to myself and you) that your
opinion may be exactly contrary to it.</p>

<p>You are very kind in what you say about wishing to
have some conversation, as the medium of your information
upon architecture, with Octavius&mdash;Occy, as we call him.
He is very much obliged to you, and proposes, if it should
not be inconvenient to you, to call upon you on Friday,
with Arabel, at about one o'clock. Friday is mentioned
because it is a holiday, no work being done at Mr. Barry's.
Otherwise he is engaged every day (except, indeed, Sunday)
from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon. May
God bless you, dearest Mr. Boyd. I am ever</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
April 16, 1844.<br />

<p>... Surely, surely, it was not likely I should lean to
utilitarianism in the notice on Carlyle, as I remember the
writer of that article leans somewhere&mdash;<i>I</i>, who am reproached
with trans-trans-transcendentalisms, and not without reason,
or with insufficient reason.</p>

<p>Oh, and I should say also that Mr. Home, in his
kindness, has enlarged considerably in his annotations and
reflections on me personally.<a name="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> My being in correspondence
with all the Kings of the East, for instance, is an exaggeration,
although literary work in one way will bring with it,
happily, literary association in others.... Still, I am not a
great letter writer, and I don't write 'elegant Latin verses,'
as all the gods of Rome know, and I have not been shut
up in the dark for seven years by any manner of means.
By the way, a barrister said to my barrister brother the
other day, 'I suppose your sister is dead?' 'Dead?' said
he, a little struck; 'dead?' 'Why, yes. After Mr. Home's
account of her being sealed up hermetically in the dark
for so many years, one can only calculate upon her being
dead by this time.'</p>

<p>ELIZABETH BARRETT.</p>

<p>Several of the letters to Mr. Boyd which follow refer to
that celebrated gift of Cyprus wine which led to the
composition of one of Miss Barrett's best known and most
quoted poems.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
June 18, 1844.<br />

<p>Thank you, my very dear friend! I write to you drunk
with Cyprus. Nothing can be worthier of either gods or
demi-gods; and if, as you say, Achilles did not drink of it,
I am sorry for him. I suppose Jupiter had it instead, just
then&mdash;Hebe pouring it, and Juno's ox-eyes bellowing their
splendour at it, if you will forgive me that broken metaphor,
for the sake of Aeschylus's genius, and my own particular
intoxication.</p>

<p>Indeed, there <i>never was</i>, in modern days, such wine.
Flush, to whom I offered the last drop in my glass, felt it
was supernatural, and ran away. I have an idea that if he
had drunk that drop, he would have talked afterwards&mdash;either
Greek or English.</p>

<p>Never was such wine! The very taste of ideal nectar,
only stiller, from keeping. If the bubbles of eternity were
on it, <i>we</i> should run away, perhaps, like Flush.</p>

<p>Still, the thought comes to me, ought I to take it from
you? Is it right of me? are you not too kind in sending
it? and should you be allowed to be too kind? In any
case, you must, not think of sending me more than you
have already sent. It is more than enough, and I am not
less than very much obliged to you.</p>

<p>I have passed the middle of my second volume, and I
only hope that critics may say of the rest that it smells of
Greek wine. Dearest Mr. Boyd's</p>

<p>Ever affectionate<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
June 28, 1844.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;I have certainly and considerably
increased the evidence of my own death by the
sepulchral silence of the last few days. But after all I am
not dead, not even <i>at heart</i>, so as to be insensible to your
kind anxiety, and I can assure you of this, upon very fair
authority, neither is the book dead yet. It has turned the
corner of the <i>felo de se</i>, and if it is to die, it will be by the
critics. The mystery of the long delay, it would not be
very easy for me to explain, notwithstanding I hear Mr.
Moxon says: 'I suppose Miss Barrett is not in a hurry
about her publication;' and <i>I</i> say: 'I suppose Moxon is
not in a hurry about the publication.' There may be a
little fault on my side, when I have kept a proof a day
beyond the hour, or when 'copy' has put out new buds
in my hands as I passed it to the printer's. Still, in my
opinion, it is a good deal more the fault of Mr. Moxon's
not being in a hurry, than in the excessive virtue of my
patience, or vice of my indolence. Miss Mitford says, as
you do, that she never heard of so slow-footed a book.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street:<br />
Wednesday, August I, 1844 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;Have you expected to hear from
me? and are you vexed with me? I am a little ambitious
of the first item&mdash;yet hopeful of an escape from the last.
If you did but know how I am pressed for time, and how
I have too much to do every day, you would forgive me
for my negligence; even if you had sent me nectar instead
of mountain,<a name="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> and I had neglected laying my gratitude at
your feet. Last Saturday, upon its being discovered that
my first volume consisted of only 208 pages, and my second
of 280 pages, Mr. Moxon uttered a cry of reprehension,
and wished to tear me to pieces by his printers, as the
Bacchantes did Orpheus. Perhaps you might have heard
my head moaning all the way to St. John's Wood! He
wanted to tear away several poems from the end of the
second volume, and tie them on to the end of the first!
I could not and would not hear of this, because I had set
my mind on having 'Dead Pan' to conclude with. So
there was nothing for it but to finish a ballad poem called
'Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' which was lying by me, and
I did so by writing, i.e. composing, <i>one hundred and forty
lines last Saturday!</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> I seemed to be in a dream all day!
Long lines too&mdash;with fifteen syllables in each! I see you
shake your head all this way off. Moreover it is a 'romance
of the age,' treating of railroads, routes, and all manner of
'temporalities,' and in so radical a temper that I expect
to be reproved for it by the Conservative reviews round.
By the way, did I tell you of the good news I had from
America the third of this month? The 'Drama of Exile' is
in the hands of a New York publisher; and having been
submitted to various chief critics of the country on its way,
was praised loudly and extravagantly. This was, however,
by a <i>private reading</i> only. A bookseller at Philadelphia
had announced it for publication&mdash;he intended to take
it up when the English edition reached America; but
upon its being represented to him that the New York
publisher had proof sheets direct from the author and would
give copy money, he abandoned his intention to the other.
I confess I feel very much pleased at the kind spirit&mdash;the
spirit of eager kindness indeed&mdash;with which the Americans
receive my poetry. It is not wrong to be pleased, I hope.
In this country there may be mortifications waiting for me;
quite enough to keep my modesty in a state of cultivation.
I do not know. I hope the work will be out this week,
and <i>then</i>! Did I explain to you that what 'Lady Geraldine's
Courtship' was wanted for was to increase the size of the
first volume, so as to restore the equilibrium of volumes,
without dislocating 'Pan'? Oh, how anxious I shall be to
hear your opinion! If you tell me that I have lost
my intellects, what in the world shall I do <i>then</i>&mdash;what
<i>shall</i> I do? My Americans&mdash;that is, my Americans
who were in at the private reading, and perhaps I myself&mdash;are
of opinion that I have made great progress since 'The Seraphim.'
It seems to me that I have more <i>reach</i>, whether in thought
or language. But then, to <i>you</i> it may appear quite otherwise,
and I shall be very melancholy if it does. Only you must tell me
the <i>precise truth</i>; and I trust to you that you will let me
have it in its integrity.</p>

<p>All the life and strength which are in me, seem to have
passed into my poetry. It is my <i>pou sto</i>&mdash;not to move the
world; but to live on in.</p>

<p>I must not forget to tell you that there is a poem towards
the end of the second volume, called 'Cyprus Wine,' which
I have done myself the honor and pleasure of associating
with your name. I thought that you would not be displeased
by it, as a proof of grateful regard from me.</p>

<p>Talking of wines, the Mountain has its attraction, but
certainly is not to be compared to the Cyprus. You will
see how I have praised the latter. Well, now I must say
'good-bye,' which you will praise <i>me</i> for!</p>

<p>Dearest Mr. Boyd's affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;<i>Nota bene</i>&mdash;I wish to forewarn you that I have cut
away in the text none of my vowels by apostrophes. When
I say 'To efface,' wanting two-syllable measure, I do not
write 'T' efface' as in the old fashion, but 'To efface' full
length. This is the style of the day. Also you will find
me a little lax perhaps in metre&mdash;a freedom which is
the result not of carelessness, but of <i>conviction</i>, and
indeed of much patient study of the great Fathers of
English poetry&mdash;not meaning Mr. Pope. Be as patient
with me as you can. You shall have the volumes as soon
as they are ready.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
August 6, 1844.<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I cannot be certain, from my
recollections, whether I did or did not write to you before,
as you suggest; but as you never received the letter and I
was in a continual press of different thoughts, the probability
is that I did not write. The Cyprus wine in the second
vial I certainly <i>did</i> receive; and was grateful to you with
the whole force of the aroma of it. And now I will tell
you an anecdote.</p>

<p>In the excess of my filial tenderness, I poured out a
glass for papa, and offered it to him with my right hand.</p>

<p>'<i>What is this</i>?' said he.</p>

<p>'<i>Taste it</i>,' said I as laconically, but with more emphasis.</p>

<p>He raised it to his lips; and, after a moment, recoiled,
with such a face as sinned against Adam's image, and with
a shudder of deep disgust.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, 'what most beastly and nauseous thing
is this? Oh,' he said, 'what detestable drug is this? Oh,
oh,' he said, 'I shall never, never, get this horrible taste
out of my mouth.'</p>

<p>I explained with the proper degree of dignity that 'it
was Greek wine, Cyprus wine, and of very great value.'</p>

<p>He retorted with acrimony, that 'it might be Greek,
twice over; but that it was exceedingly beastly.'</p>

<p>I resumed, with persuasive argument, that 'it could
scarcely be beastly, inasmuch as the taste reminded one
of oranges and orange flower together, to say nothing of
the honey of Mount Hymettus.'</p>

<p>He took me up with stringent logic, 'that any wine
must positively be beastly, which, pretending to be wine,
tasted sweet as honey, and that it was beastly on my own
showing!' I send you this report as an evidence of a
curious opinion. But drinkers of port wine cannot be
expected to judge of nectar&mdash;and I hold your 'Cyprus' to
be pure nectar.</p>

<p>I shall have pleasure in doing what you ask me to do&mdash;that
is, I <i>will</i>&mdash;if you promise never to call me Miss Barrett
again. You have often quite vexed me by it. There is
Ba&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;Elzbeth&mdash;Ellie&mdash;any modification of my
name you may call me by&mdash;but I won't be called Miss
Barrett by <i>you</i>. Do you understand? Arabel means to
carry your copy of my book to you. And I beg you not
to fancy that I shall be impatient for you to read the two
volumes through. If you <i>ever</i> read them through, it will
be a sufficient compliment, and indeed I do not expect that
you <i>ever will</i>.</p>

<p>May God bless you, dearest Mr. Boyd.</p>

<p>I remain,</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>The date of this last letter marks, as nearly as need be,
the date of publication of Miss Barrett's volumes. The
letters which follow deal mainly with their reception, first
at the hand of friends, and then by the regular critics. The
general verdict of the latter was extremely complimentary.
Mr. Chorley, in the 'Athenaeum,'<a name="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> described the volumes
as 'extraordinary,' adding that 'between her [Miss Barrett's]
poems and the slighter lyrics of most of the sisterhood, there
is all the difference which exists between the putting-on of
&quot;singing robes&quot; for altar service, and the taking up lute or
harp to enchant an indulgent circle of friends and kindred.'
In the 'Examiner,'<a name="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> John Forster declared that 'Miss
Barrett is an undoubted poetess of a high and fine order as
regards the first requisites of her art&mdash;imagination and
expression.... She is a most remarkable writer, and her
volumes contain not a little which the lovers of poetry will
never willingly let die,' a phrase then not quite so hackneyed
as it has since become. The 'Atlas'<a name="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> asserted that 'the
present volumes show extraordinary powers, and, abating the
failings of which all the followers of Tennyson are guilty,
extraordinary genius.' More influential even than these,
'Blackwood'<a name="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> paid her the compliment of a whole article,
criticising her faults frankly, but declaring that 'her poetical
merits infinitively outweigh her defects. Her genius is
profound, unsullied, and without a flaw.' All agreed in
assigning her a high, or the highest, place among the
poetesses of England; but, as Miss Barrett herself pointed
out, this, in itself, was no great praise.<a name="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p>With regard to individual poems, the critics did not take
kindly to the 'Drama of Exile,' and 'Blackwood' in particular
criticised it at considerable length, calling it 'the least
successful of her works.' The subject, while half challenging
comparison with Milton, lends itself only too readily to
fancifulness and unreality, which were among the most
besetting sins of Miss Barrett's genius. The minor poems
were incomparably more popular, and the favourite of all
was that masterpiece of rhetorical sentimentality, 'Lady
Geraldine's Courtship.' It must have been a little mortifying
to the authoress to find this piece, a large part of
which had been dashed off at a single heat in order to
supply the printers' needs, preferred to others on which she
had employed all the labour of her deliberate art; but
with the general tone of all the critics she had every reason
to be as content as her letters show her to have been. Only
two criticisms rankled: the one that she was a follower of
Tennyson, the other that her rhymes were slovenly and careless.
And these appeared, in varying shapes, in nearly all
the reviews.</p>

<p>The former of these allegations is of little weight.
Whatever qualities Miss Barrett may have shared with
Tennyson, her substantial independence is unquestionable.
It is a case rather of coincidence than imitation; or if
imitation, it is of a slight and unconscious kind. The second
criticism deserves fuller notice, because it is constantly
repeated to this day. The following letters show how
strongly Miss Barrett protested against it. As she told
Horne,<a name="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> with reference to this very subject:</p>

<blockquote>'If I fail ultimately before the public&mdash;that is, before the people&mdash;for
an ephemeral popularity does not appear to me to be
worth trying for&mdash;it will not be because I have shrunk from
the amount of labour, where labour could do anything. I
have <i>worked</i> at poetry; it has not been with me reverie, but
art.'
</blockquote>

<p>That her rhymes were inexact, especially in such
poems as 'The Dead Pan,' she did not deny; but her
defence was that the inexactness was due to a deliberate
attempt to widen the artistic capabilities of the English
language. Partly, perhaps, as a result of her acquaintance
with Italian literature, she had a marked fondness for
disyllabic rhymes; and since pure rhymes of this kind are
not plentiful in English, she tried the experiment of using
assonances instead. Hence such rhymes as <i>silence</i> and
<i>islands</i>, <i>vision</i> and <i>procession</i>,
<i>panther</i> and <i>saunter</i>, examples
which could be indefinitely multiplied if need were. Now
it may be that a writer with a very sensitive ear would not
have attempted such an experiment, and it is a fact that public
taste has not approved it; but the experiment itself is as
legitimate as, say, the metrical experiments in hexameters
and hendecasyllabics of Longfellow or Tennyson, and
whether approved or not it should be criticised as an
experiment, not as mere carelessness. That Mrs. Browning's
ear was quite-capable of discerning true rhymes is shown by
the fact that she tacitly abandoned her experiment in
assonances. Not only in the pure and high art of the
'Sonnets from the Portuguese,' but even in 'Casa Guidi
Windows,' the rhetorical and sometimes colloquial tone of
which might have been thought to lend itself to such
devices, imperfect rhymes occur but rarely not exceeding
the limits allowed to himself by every poet who has rhymed
<i>given</i> and <i>heaven</i>; and the roll of those who have
<i>not</i> done so must be small indeed.</p>

<p>The point has seemed worth dwelling on, because it
touches a commonplace of criticism as regards Mrs. Browning;
but we may now make way for her own comments on
her critics and friends.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Tuesday, August 13, 1844 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I must thank you for the great
kindness with which you have responded to a natural
expression of feeling on my part, and for all the pleasure of
finding you pleased with the inscription of 'Cyprus Wine.'
Your note has given me much true pleasure. Yes; if my
verses survive me, I should wish them to relate the fact of
my being your debtor for many happy hours.</p>

<p>And now I must explain to you that most of the 'incorrectnesses'
you speak of may be 'incorrectnesses,' but are not
<i>negligences</i>. I have a theory about double rhymes for
which&mdash;I shall be attacked by the critics, but which I could
justify perhaps on high authority, or at least analogy. In
fact, these volumes of mine have more double rhymes than
any two books of English poems that ever to my knowledge
were printed; I mean of English poems <i>not comic</i>. Now,
of double rhymes in use, which are perfect rhymes, you are
aware how few there are, and yet you are also aware of
what an admirable effect in making a rhythm various and
vigorous, double rhyming is in English poetry. Therefore
I have used a certain licence; and after much thoughtful
study of the Elizabethan writers, have ventured it with the
public. And do <i>you</i> tell me, <i>you</i> who object to the use of
a different <i>vowel</i> in a double rhyme, <i>why</i> you rhyme (as
everybody does, without blame from anybody) 'given' to
'heaven,' when you object to my rhyming 'remember' and
'chamber'? The analogy surely is all on my side, and I
<i>believe</i> that the spirit of the English language is also.</p>

<p>I write all this because you will find many other sins
of the sort, besides those in the 'Cyprus Wine;' and
because I wish you to consider the subject as <i>a point for
consideration</i> seriously, and not to blame me as a writer of
careless verses. If I deal too much in licences, it is not
because I am idle, but because I am speculative for freedom's
sake. It is possible, you know, to be wrong conscientiously;
and I stand up for my conscience only.</p>

<p>I thank you earnestly for your candour hitherto, and I
beseech you to be candid to the end.</p>

It is tawny as Rhea's lion.<br />

<p>I know (although you don't say so) you object to that
line. Yet consider its structure. Does not the final 'y' of
'tawny' suppose an apostrophe and apocope? Do you not
run 'tawny as' into two syllables naturally? I want you to
see my principle.</p>

<p>With regard to blank verse, the great Fletcher admits
sometimes seventeen syllables into his lines.</p>

<p>I hope Miss Heard received her copy, and that you will
not think me arrogant in writing freely to you.</p>

<p>Believe me, I write only freely and not arrogantly; and
I am impressed with the conviction that my work abounds
with far more faults than you in your kindness will discover,
notwithstanding your acumen.</p>

<p>Always your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIBET.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Wednesday, August 14, 1844 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I must thank you for the great
great pleasure with which I have this moment read your
note, the more welcome, as (without hypocrisy) I had
worked myself up into a nervous apprehension, from your
former one, that I should seem so 'rudis atque incomposita'
to you, in consequence of certain licences, as to end by
being intolerable. I know what an ear you have, and how
you can hear the dust on the wheel as it goes on. Well, I
wrote to you yesterday, to beg you to be patient and considerate.</p>

<p>But you are always given to surprise me with abundant
kindness&mdash;with supererogatory kindness. I believe in <i>that</i>,
certainly.</p>

<p>I am very very glad that you think me stronger and
more perspicuous. For the perspicuity, I have struggled
hard....</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELZBETH.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: August 22, 1844.<br />

<p>... Thank you for your welcome letter, so kind in its
candour, <i>I</i> angry that you should prefer 'The Seraphim'!
Angry? No <i>indeed, indeed</i>, I am grateful for 'The Seraphim,'
and not exacting for the 'Drama,' and all the more because
of a secret obstinate persuasion that the 'Drama' will have
a majority of friends in the end, and perhaps deserve to have
them. Nay, why should I throw perhapses over my own
impressions, and be insincere to you who have honoured
me by being sincere? Why should I dissemble my own
belief that the 'Drama' is worth two or three 'Seraphims'&mdash;<i>my
own</i> belief, you know, which is worth nothing, writers
knowing themselves so superficially, and having such a
natural leaning to their last work. Still, I may say honestly
to you, that I have a far more modest value for 'The Seraphim'
than your kindness suggests, and that I have seemed to
myself to have a clear insight into the fact that that poem
was only borne up by the minor poems published with it,
from immediate destruction. There is a want of unity in it
which vexes me to think of, and the other faults magnify
themselves day by day, more and more, in my eyes. Therefore
it is not that I care <i>more</i> for the 'Drama,' but I care
less for 'The Seraphim.' Both poems fall short of my
aspiration and desire, but the 'Drama' seems to me fuller,
freer and stronger, and worth the other three times over.
If it has anything new, I think it must be something new
into which I have lived, for certainly I wrote it sincerely and
from an inner impulse. In fact, I never wrote any poem
with so much sense of pleasure in the composition, and so
rapidly, with continuous flow&mdash;from fifty to a hundred lines
a day, and quite in a glow of pleasure and impulse all
through. Still, you have not been used to see me in blank
verse, and there may be something in that. That the poem
is full of faults and imperfections I do not in the least doubt.
I have vibrated between exultations and despondencies in
the correcting and printing of it, though the composition
went smoothly to an end, and I am prepared to receive the
bastinado to the critical degree, I do assure you. The few
opinions I have yet had are all to the effect that my advance
on the former publication is very great and obvious, but
then I am aware that people who thought exactly the
contrary would be naturally backward in giving me their
opinion.... Indeed, I thank you most earnestly. Truth
and kindness, how rarely do they come together! I am
very grateful to you. It is curious that 'Duchess May' is
not a favorite of mine, and that I have sighed one or two
secret wishes towards its extirpation, but other writers
besides yourself have singled it out for praise in private
letters to me. There has been no printed review yet, I
believe; and when I think of them, I try to think of something
else, for with no private friends among the critical
body (not that I should desire to owe security in such a
matter to private friendship) it is awful enough, this looking
forward to be reviewed. Never mind, the ultimate prosperity
of the book lies far above the critics, and can neither
be mended nor made nor unmade by <i>them</i>.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Wednesday morning [August 1844].<br />

<p>I return Mr. Chorley's<a name="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> note, my dear cousin, with
thankful thoughts of him&mdash;as of you. I wish I could persuade
you of the rightness of my view about 'Essays on
Mind' and such things, and how the difference between them
and my present poems is not merely the difference between
two schools, as you seemed to intimate yesterday, nor even
the difference between immaturity and maturity; but that
it is the difference between the dead and the living, between
a copy and an individuality, between what is myself and
what is not myself. To you who have a personal interest
and&mdash;may I say? affection for me, the girl's exercise assumes
a factitious value, but to the public the matter is otherwise
and ought to be otherwise. And for the 'psychological'
side of the question, <i>do</i> observe that I have not reputation
enough to suggest a curiosity about <i>my legends</i>. Instead of
your 'legendary lore,' it would be just a legendary bore.
Now you understand what I mean. I do not underrate
Pope nor his school, but I <i>do</i> disesteem everything which,
bearing the shape of a book, is not the true expression of a
mind, and I know and feel (and so do <i>you</i>) that a girl's
exercise written when all the experience lay in books, and
the mind was suited rather for intelligence than production,
lying like an infant's face with an undeveloped expression,
must be valueless in itself, and if offered to the public
directly or indirectly as a work of mine, highly injurious to
me. Why, of the 'Prometheus' volume, even, you know what
I think and desire. 'The Seraphim,' with all its feebleness
and shortcomings and obscurities, yet is the first utterance
of my own individuality, and therefore the only volume
except the last which is not a disadvantage to me to have
thought of, and happily for me, the early books, never
having been advertised, nor reviewed, except by accident,
once or twice, are as safe from the public as manuscript.</p>

<p>Oh, I shudder to think of the lines which might have
been 'nicked in,' and all through Mr. Chorley's good nature.
As if I had not sins enough to ruin me in the new poems,
without reviving juvenile ones, sinned when I knew no
better. Perhaps you would like to have the series of epic
poems which I wrote from nine years old to eleven. They
might illustrate some doctrine of innate ideas, and enrich
(to that end) the myths of metaphysicians.</p>

<p>And also agree with me in reverencing that wonderful
genius <i>Keats</i>, who, rising as a grand exception from among
the vulgar herd of juvenile versifiers, was an individual <i>man</i>
from the beginning, and spoke with his own voice, though
surrounded by the yet unfamiliar murmur of antique
echoes.<a name="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> Leigh Hunt calls him 'the young poet' very
rightly. Most affectionately and gratefully yours,</p>

<p>E.B.B.</p>

<p>Do thank Mr. Chorley for me, will you?</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Thursday, August 1844.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dearest Mrs. Martin, for your most kind
letter, a reply to which should certainly, as you desired, have
met you at Colwall; only, right or wrong, I have been
flurried, agitated, put out of the way altogether, by Stormie's
and Henry's plan of going to Egypt. Ah, now you are
surprised. Now you think me excusable for being silent
two days beyond my time&mdash;yes, and <i>they have gone</i>, it is no
vague speculation. You know, or perhaps you don't know,
that, a little time back, papa bought a ship, put a captain
and crew of his own in it, and began to employ it in his
favourite 'Via Lactea' of speculations. It has been once to
Odessa with wool, I think; and now it has gone to
Alexandria with coals. Stormie was wild to go to both
places; and with regard to the last, papa has yielded. And
Henry goes too. This was all arranged weeks ago, but
nothing was said of it until last Monday to me; and when
I heard it, I was a good deal moved of course, and although
resigned now to their having their way in it, and their
<i>pleasure</i>, which is better than their way, still I feel I have
entered a new anxiety, and shall not be quite at ease again
till they return....</p>

<p>And now to thank you, my ever-dearest Mrs. Martin,
for your kind and welcome letter from the Lakes. I knew
quite at the first page, and long before you said a word
specifically, that dear Mr. Martin was better, and think that
such a scene, even from under an umbrella, must have done
good to the soul and body of both of you. I wish I could
have looked through your eyes for once. But I suppose
that neither through yours, nor through my own, am I ever
likely to behold that sight. In the meantime it is with considerable
satisfaction that I hear of your <i>failure of Wordsworth</i>,
which was my salvation in a very awful sense. Why,
if you had done such a thing, you would have put me to the
shame of too much honor. The speculation consoles me
entirely for your loss in respect to Rydal Hall and its poet.
By the way, I heard the other day that Rogers, who was
intending to visit him, said, 'It is a bad time of year for it.
The god is on his pedestal; and can only give gestures to
his worshippers, and no conversation to his friends.' ...</p>

<p>Although you did not find a letter from me on your
return to Colwall, I do hope that you found <i>me</i>&mdash;viz. my
book, which Mr. Burden took charge of, and promised to
deliver or see delivered. When you have read it, <i>do</i> let me
hear your own and Mr. Martin's true impression; and
whether you think it worse or better than 'The Seraphim.'
The only review which has yet appeared or had time to
appear has been a very kind and cordial one in the
'Athenaeum.' ...</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
August 31, 1844.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;I send you the manuscript you
ask for, and also my certificate that, although I certainly
was once a little girl, yet I never in my life had fair hair, or
received lessons when you mention. I think a cousin of
mine, now dead, may have done it. The 'Barrett Barrett'
seems to specify my family. I have a little cousin with
bright fair hair at this moment who is an Elizabeth Barrett
(the subject of my 'Portrait'<a name="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>), but then she is a 'Georgiana'
besides, and your friend must refer to times past. My
hair is very dark indeed, and always was, as long as I
remember, and also I have a friend who makes serious
affidavit that I have never changed (except by being rather
taller) since I was a year old. Altogether, you cannot
make a case of identity out, and I am forced to give up the
glory of being so long remembered for my cleverness.</p>

<p>You do wrong in supposing me inclined to underrate
Mr. Melville's power. He is inclined to High-Churchism,
and to such doctrines as apostolical succession, and I, who,
am a Dissenter, and a believer in a universal Christianity,
recoil from the exclusive doctrine.</p>

<p>But then, that is not depreciatory of his power and
eloquence&mdash;surely not.</p>

<p>E.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Monday.<br />
[About the end of August 1844.]<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Chorley,&mdash;Kindnesses are more frequent things
with me than gladnesses, but I thank you earnestly for both
in the letter I have this moment received.<a name="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> You have given
me a quick sudden pleasure which goes deeper (I am very
sure) than self-love, for it must be something better than
vanity that brings the tears so near the eyes. I thank you,
dear Mr. Chorley.</p>

<p>After all, we are not quite strangers. I have had some
early encouragement and direction from you, and much
earlier (and later) literary pleasures from such of your
writings as did not refer to me. I have studied 'Music and
Manners'<a name="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> under you, and found an excuse for my love of
romance-reading from your grateful fancy. Then, as dear
Miss Mitford's friend, you could not help being (however
against your will!) a little my acquaintance; and this she
daringly promised to make you in reality some day, till I
took the fervour for prophecy.</p>

<p>Altogether I am justified, while I thank you as a stranger,
to say one more word as a friend, and <i>that</i> shall be the
best word&mdash;'<i>May God bless you</i>!' The trials with which
He tries us all are different, but our faces may be turned
towards the end in cheerfulness, for '<i>to</i> the end He has loved
us.' I remain,</p>

<p>Very faithfully, your obliged<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>You may trust me with the secret of your kindness to
me. It shall not go farther.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Monday, September 1, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I thank you for the Cyprus, and
also for a still sweeter amreeta&mdash;your praise. Certainly to
be praised as you praise me might well be supposed likely
to turn a sager head than mine, but I feel that (with all
my sensitive and grateful appreciation of such words) I am
removed rather below than above the ordinary temptations
of vanity. Poetry is to me rather a passion than an
ambition, and the gadfly which drives me along that road
pricks deeper than an expectation of fame could do.</p>

<p>Moreover, there will be plenty of counter-irritation to
prevent me from growing feverish under your praises.
And as a beginning, I hear that the 'John Bull' newspaper
has cut me up with sanguinary gashes, for the edification of
its Sabbath readers. I have not seen it yet, but I hear so.
The 'Drama' is the particular victim. Do not send for the
paper. I will let you have it, if you should wish for it.</p>

<p>One thing is left to me to say. Arabel told you of a
letter I had received from a professional critic, and I am
sorry that she should have told you so without binding you
to secrecy on the point at the same time. In fact, the
writer of the letter begged me <i>not</i> to speak of it, and I
took an engagement to him <i>not</i> to speak of it. Now it
would be very unpleasant to me, and dishonorable to me,
if, after entering into this engagement, the circumstance of
the letter should come to be talked about. Of course you
will understand that I do not object to your having been
informed of the thing, only Arabel should have remembered
to ask you not to mention again the name of the critic who
wrote to me.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my very dear friend. I drink
thoughts of you in Cyprus every day.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
September 10, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I will not lose a post in assuring
you that I was not silent because of any disappointment
from your previous letter. I could only feel the <i>kindness</i> of
that letter, and this was certainly the chief and uppermost
feeling at the time of reading it, and since. Your
preference of 'The Seraphim' one other person besides
yourself has acknowledged to me in the same manner, and
although I myself&mdash;perhaps from the natural leaning to
last works, and perhaps from a wise recognition of the
complete failure of the poem called 'The Seraphim '&mdash;do
disagree with you, yet I can easily forgive you for such a
thought, and believe that you see sufficient grounds for
entertaining it. More and more I congratulate myself (at
any rate) for the decision I came to at the last moment, and
in the face of some persuasions, to call the book 'Poems,'
instead of trusting its responsibility to the 'Drama,' by such
a title as 'A Drama of Exile, and Poems.' It is plain, as I
anticipated, that for one person who is ever so little pleased
with the 'Drama,' fifty at least will like the smaller poems.
And perhaps they are right. The longer sustaining of a
subject requires, of course, more power, and I may have failed
in it altogether.</p>

<p>Yes, I think I may say that I am satisfied so far with
the aspect of things in relation to the book. You see there
has scarcely been time yet to give any except a sanguine or
despondent judgment&mdash;I mean, there is scarcely room yet
for forming a very rational inference of what will ultimately
be, without the presentiments of hope or fear. The book
came out too late in August for any chance of a mention
in the September magazines, and at the dead time of
year, when the very critics were thinking more of holiday
innocence than of their carnivorous instincts. This will not
hurt it ultimately, although it might have hurt a <i>novel</i>. The
regular critics will come back to it; and in the meantime
the newspaper critics are noticing it all round, with more
or less admissions to its advantage. The 'Atlas' is the
best of the newspapers for literary notices; and it spoke
graciously on the whole; though I do protest against being
violently attached to a 'school.' I have faults enough, I
know; but it is just to say that they are at least my own.
Well, then! It is true that the 'Westminster Review' says
briefly what is great praise, and promises to take the earliest
opportunity of reviewing me 'at large.' So that with regard
to the critics, there seems to be a good prospect. Then I
have had some very pleasant private letters&mdash;one from
Carlyle; an oath from Miss Martineau to give her whole
mind to the work and tell me her free and full opinion,
which I have not received yet; an assurance from an
acquaintance of Mrs. Jameson that she was much pleased.
But the letter which pleased me most was addressed to me by
a professional critic, personally unknown to me, who wrote
to say that he had traced me up, step by step, ever since I
began to print, and that my last volumes were so much
better than any preceding them, and were such <i>living books</i>,
that they restored to him the impulses of his youth and
constrained him to thank me for the pleasant emotions they
had excited. I cannot say the name of the writer of this
letter, because he asked me not to do so, but of course it was
very pleasant to read. Now you will not call me vain for
speaking of this. I would not speak of it; only I want (you
see) to prove to you how faithfully and gratefully I have a
trust in your kindness and sympathy. It is certainly the
best kindness to speak the truth to me. I have written
those poems as well as I could, and I hope to write others
better. I have not reached my own ideal; and I cannot
expect to have satisfied other people's expectation. But it
is (as I sometimes say) the least ignoble part of me, that
I love poetry better than I love my own successes in it.</p>

<p>I am glad that you like 'The Lost Bower.' The scene of
that poem is the wood above the garden at Hope End.</p>

<p>It is very true, my dearest Mrs. Martin, all that you say
about the voyage to Alexandria. And I do not feel the
anxiety I <i>thought I should</i>. In fact, <i>I am surprised to feel
so little anxiety</i>. Still, when they are at home again, I shall
be happier than I am now, <i>that</i> I feel strongly besides.</p>

<p>What I missed most in your first letter was what I do
not miss in the second, the good news of dear Mr. Martin.
Both he and you are very vainglorious, I suppose, about
O'Connell; but although I was delighted on every account at
his late victory,<a name="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> or rather at the late victory of justice and
constitutional law, he never was a hero of mine and is not
likely to become one. If he had been (by the way) a hero
of mine, I should have been quite ashamed of him for being
so unequal to his grand position as was demonstrated by the
speech from the balcony. Such poetry in the position, and
such prose in the speech! He has not the stuff in him
of which heroes are made. There is a thread of cotton
everywhere crossing the silk....</p>

<p>With our united love to both of you,<br />
Ever, dearest Mrs. Martin, most affectionately yours,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Wednesday [about September 1844].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin, ... Did I tell you that Miss
Martineau had promised and vowed to me to tell me the
whole truth with respect to the poems? Her letter did not
come until a few days ago, and for a full month after the
publication; and I was so fearful of the probable sentence
that my hands shook as they broke the seal. But such a
pleasant letter! I have been overjoyed with it. She says
that her 'predominant impression is of the <i>originality</i>'&mdash;very
pleasant to hear. I must not forget, however, to say that
she complains of 'want of variety' in the general effect of
the drama, and that she 'likes Lucifer less than anything
in the two volumes.' You see how you have high backers.
Still she talks of 'immense advances,' which consoles me
again. In fact, there is scarcely a word to <i>require</i> consolation
in her letter, and what did not please me least&mdash;nay, to
do myself justice, what put all the rest out of my head
for some minutes with joy&mdash;is the account she gives of
herself. For she is better and likely still to be better;
she has recovered appetite and sleep, and lost the most
threatening symptoms of disease; she has been out for the
first time for four years and a half, lying on the grass
flat, she says, with my books open beside her day after day.
(That <i>does</i> sound vain of me, but I cannot resist the temptation
of writing it!) And the means&mdash;the means! Such
means you would never divine! It is <i>mesmerism</i>. She is
thrown into the magnetic trance twice a day; and the
progress is manifest; and the hope for the future clear.
Now, what do you both think? Consider what a case it
is! No case of a weak-minded woman and a nervous
affection; but of the most manlike woman in the three
kingdoms&mdash;in the best sense of man&mdash;a woman gifted
with admirable fortitude, as well as exercised in high logic,
a woman of sensibility and of imagination certainly, but
apt to carry her reason unbent wherever she sets her foot;
given to utilitarian philosophy and the habit of logical
analysis; and suffering under a disease which has induced
change of structure and yielded to no tried remedy! Is it
not wonderful, and past expectation? She suggests that
I should try the means&mdash;but I understand that in cases
like mine the remedy has done harm instead of good, by
over-exciting the system. But her experience will settle
the question of the reality of magnetism with a whole
generation of infidels. For my own part, I have long
been a believer, <i>in spite of papa</i>. Then I have had very
kind letters from Mrs. Jameson, the 'Ennuy&eacute;e'<a name="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> and
from Mr. Serjeant Talfourd and some less famous persons.
And a poet with a Welsh name wrote to me yesterday to
say that he was writing a poem 'similar to my &quot;Drama of
Exile,&quot;' and begged me to subscribe to it. Now I tell you
all this to make you smile, and because some of it will
interest you more gravely. It will prove to dear unjust
Mr. Martin that I do not distrust your sympathy. How
could he think so of me? I am half vexed that he should
think so. Indeed&mdash;indeed I am not so morbidly vain.
Why, if you had told me that the books were without any
sort of value in your eyes, do you imagine that I should
not have valued you, reverenced you ever after for your
truth, so sacred a thing in friendship? I really believe it
would have been my predominant feeling. But you
proved your truth without trying me so hardly; I had <i>both</i>
truth and praise from you, and surely quite enough, and
<i>more</i> than enough, as many would think, of the latter.</p>

<p>My dearest papa left us this morning to go for a few
days into Cornwall for the purpose of examining a quarry
in which he has bought or is about to buy shares, and he
means to strike on for the Land's End and to see Falmouth
before he returns. It depresses me to think of his being
away; his presence or the sense of his nearness having so
much cheering and soothing influence with me; but it will
be an excellent change for him, even if he does not, as he
expects, dig an immense fortune out of the quarries....</p>

<p>Your affectionate and ever obliged<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Cornelius Mathews</i><br />
London, 50 Wimpole Street: October 1, 1844.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Mathews,&mdash;I have just received your note,
which, on the principle of single sighs or breaths being
wafted from Indies to the poles, arrived quite safely, and I
was very glad to have it. I shall fall into monotony if I
go on to talk of my continued warm sense of your wonderful
kindness to me, a stranger according to the manner of men;
and, indeed, I have just this moment been writing a note to
a friend two streets away, and calling it 'wonderful kindness.'
I cannot, however, of course, allow you to run the
tether of your impulse and furnish me with the reviews of my
books and other things you speak of at your own expense,
and I should prefer, if you would have the goodness to give
the necessary direction to Messrs. Putnam &amp; Co., that they
should send what would interest me to see, together with a
note of the pecuniary debt to themselves. I shall like to
see the reviews, of course; and that you should have taken
the first word of American judgment into your own mouth
is a pleasant thought to me, and leaves me grateful. In
England I have no reason so far to be otherwise than well
pleased. There has not, indeed, been much yet besides newspaper
criticisms&mdash;except 'Ainsworth's Magazine,' which is
benignant!&mdash;there has not been time. The monthly reviews
give themselves 'pause' in such matters to set the plumes
of their dignity, and I am rather glad than otherwise not to
have the first fruits of their haste. The 'Atlas,' the best
newspaper for literary reviews, excepting always the
'Examiner,' who does not speak yet, is generous to me, and I
have reason to be satisfied with others. And our most influential
quarterly (after the 'Edinburgh' and right 'Quarterly'),
the 'Westminster Review,' promises an early paper with
passing words of high praise. What vexed me a little in
one or two of the journals was an attempt made to fix me in
a school, and the calling me a follower of Tennyson for my
habit of using compound words, noun-substantives, which
I used to do before I knew a page of Tennyson, and
adopted from a study of our old English writers, and
Greeks and even Germans. The custom is so far from
being peculiar to Tennyson, that Shelley and Keats and
Leigh Hunt are all redolent of it, and no one can read our
old poets without perceiving the leaning of our Saxon to
that species of coalition. Then I have had letters of great
kindness from 'Spirits of the Age,' whose praises are so
many crowns, and altogether am far from being out of
spirits about the prospect of my work. I am glad, however,
that I gave the name of 'Poems' to the work instead of admitting
the 'Drama of Exile' into the title-page and increasing
its responsibility; for one person who likes the 'Drama,'
ten like the other poems. Both Carlyle and Miss Martineau
select as favorite 'Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' which amuses
and surprises me somewhat. In that poem I had endeavoured
to throw conventionalities (turned asbestos for the nonce)
into the fire of poetry, to make them glow and glitter as if
they were not dull things. Well, I shall soon hear what <i>you</i>
like best&mdash;and worst. I wonder if you have been very
carnivorous with me! I tremble a little to think of your
hereditary claim to an instrument called the tomahawk.
Still, I am sure I shall have to think <i>most</i>, ever as now, of
your kindness; and <i>truth</i> must be sacred to all of us,
whether we have to suffer or be glad by it. As for Mr.
Horne, I cannot answer for what he has received or not
received. I had one note from him on silver paper (fear of
postage having reduced him to a transparency) from
Germany, and that is all, and I did not think him in good
spirits in what he said of himself. I will tell him what you
have the goodness to say, and something, too, on my own
part. He has had a hard time of it with his 'Spirit of the
Age;' the attacks on the book here being bitter in the
extreme. Your 'Democratic' does not comfort him for the
rest, by the way, and, indeed, he is almost past comfort on
the subject. I had a letter the other day from Dr. Shelton
Mackenzie, whom I do not know personally, but who is
about to publish a 'Living Author Dictionary,' and who, by
some association, talked of the effeminacy of 'the American
poets,' so I begged him to read your poems on 'Man' and
prepare an exception to his position. I wish to write more
and must not.</p>

<p>Most faithfully yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>Am I the first with the great and good news for America
and England that Harriet Martineau is better and likely to
be better? She told me so herself, and attributes the change
to the agency of <i>mesmerism</i>.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
October 4, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;... As to 'The Lost Bower,'
I am penitent about having caused you so much disturbance.
I sometimes fancy that a little varying of the accents, though
at the obvious expense of injuring the smoothness of every
line considered separately, gives variety of cadence and fuller
harmony to the general effect. But I do not question that I
deserve a great deal of blame on this point as on others. Many
lines in 'Isobel's Child' are very slovenly and weak from a
multitude of causes. I hope you will like 'The Lost Bower'
better when you try it again than you did at first, though I
do not, of course, expect that you will not see much to cry
out against. The subject of the poem was an actual fact of
my childhood.</p>

<p>Oh, and I think I told you, when giving you the history
of 'Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' that I wrote the <i>thirteen</i>
last pages of it in one day. I ought to have said <i>nineteen</i>
pages instead. But don't tell anybody; only keep the
circumstance in your mind when you need it and see the
faults. Nobody knows of it except you and Mr. Kenyon
and my own family for the reason I told you. I sent off
that poem to the press piece-meal, as I never in my life did
before with any poem. And since I wrote to you I have
heard of Mr. Eagles, one of the first writers in 'Blackwood'
and a man of very refined taste, adding another name to the
many of those who have preferred it to anything in the two
volumes. He says that he has read it at least six times
aloud to various persons, and calls it a 'beautiful <i>sui
generis</i> drama.' On which Mr. Kenyon observes that I am 'ruined
for life, and shall be sure never to take pains with any poem
again.'</p>

<p>The American edition (did Arabel tell you?) was to be
out in New York a week ago, and was to consist of fifteen
hundred copies in two volumes, as in England.</p>

<p>She sends you the verses and asks you to make allowances
for the delay in doing so. I cannot help believing that if
you were better read in Wordsworth you would appreciate
him better. Ever since I knew what poetry is, I have
believed in him as a great poet, and I do not understand
how reasonably there can be a doubt of it. Will you remember
that nearly all the first minds of the age have admitted
his power (without going to intrinsic evidence), and then say
that he <i>can</i> be a mere Grub Street writer? It is not that he
is only or chiefly admired by the <i>profanum vulgus</i>, that he
is a mere popular and fashionable poet, but that men of
genius in this and other countries unite in confessing his
genius. And is not this a significant circumstance&mdash;significant,
at least?...</p>

<p>Believe me, yourself, your affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIBET B.B.</p>

<p>How kind you are, far too kind, about the Cyprus wine;
I thank you very much.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
October 5, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;... Well, papa came back
from Cornwall just as I came back to my own room, and he
was as pleased with his quarry as I was to have the sight
again of his face. During his absence, Henrietta had a
little polka (which did not bring the house down on its
knees), and I had a transparent blind put up in my open
window. There is a castle in the blind, and a castle gate-way,
and two walks, and several peasants, and groves of
trees which rise in excellent harmony with the fall of my
green damask curtains&mdash;new, since you saw me last. Papa
insults me with the analogy of a back window in a confectioner's
shop, but is obviously moved when the sunshine
lights up the castle, notwithstanding. And Mr. Kenyon
and everybody in the house grow ecstatic rather than otherwise,
as they stand in contemplation before it, and tell me
(what is obvious without their evidence) that the effect
is beautiful, and that the whole room catches a light
from it. Well, and then Mr. Kenyon has given me a new
table, with a rail round it to consecrate it from Flush's
paws, and large enough to hold all my varieties of vanities.</p>

<p>I had another letter from Miss Martineau the other day,
and she says she has a 'hat of her own, a parasol of her
own,' and that she can 'walk a mile with ease.' <i>What do
miracles mean</i>? Miracle or not, however, one thing is
certain&mdash;it is very joyful; and her own sensations on being
removed suddenly from the verge of the prospect of a most
painful death&mdash;a most painful and lingering death&mdash;must be
strange and overwhelming.</p>

<p>I hope I may hear soon from you that you had much
pleasure at Clifton, and some benefit in the air and change,
and that dear Mr. Martin and yourself are both as well as
possible. Do you take in 'Punch'? If not, you <i>ought</i>.
Mr. Kenyon and I agreed the other day that we should be
more willing 'to take our politics' from 'Punch' than from
any other of the newspaper oracles. 'Punch' is very
generous, and I like him for everything, except for his rough
treatment of Louis Philippe, whom I believe to be a great
man&mdash;for a king. And then, it is well worth fourpence to
laugh once a week. I do recommend 'Punch' to you.<a name="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>
Douglas Jerrold is the editor, I fancy, and he has a troop of
'wits,' such as Planch&eacute;, Titmarsh, and the author of 'Little
Peddlington,' to support him....</p>

<p>Now I have written enough to tire you, I am sure.
May God bless you both! Did you read 'Coningsby,' that
very able book, without character, story, or specific teaching?
It is well worth reading, and worth wondering over.
D'Israeli, who is a man of genius, has written, nevertheless,
books which will live longer, and move deeper. But everybody
should read 'Coningsby.' It is a sign of the times.
Believe me, my dearest Mrs. Martin,</p>

<p>Your very affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
Tuesday, October 8, 1844.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dearest cousin, for your kind little note,
which I run the chance of answering by that Wednesday's
post you think you may wait for. So (<i>via</i> your table) I set
about writing to you, and the first word, of course, must be
an expression of my contentment with the 'Examiner'
review. Indeed, I am more than contented&mdash;delighted
with it. I had some dread, vaguely fashioned, about the
'Examiner'; the very delay looked ominous. And then, I
thought to myself, though I did not say, that if Mr. Forster
praised the verses on Flush to you, it was just because he
had no sympathy for anything else. But it is all the
contrary, you see, and I am the more pleased for the want
of previous expectation; and I must add that if <i>you</i> were
so kind as to be glad of being associated with me by Mr.
Forster's reference, <i>I</i> was so <i>human</i> as to be very very glad
of being associated with <i>you</i> by the same. Also you shall
criticise 'Geraldine' exactly as you like&mdash;mind, I don't think
it all so rough as the extracts appear to be, and some variety
is attained by that playing at ball with the <i>pause</i>, which
causes the apparent roughness&mdash;still you shall criticise
'Geraldine' exactly as you like. I have a great fancy for
writing some day a longer poem of a like class&mdash;a poem
comprehending the aspect and manners of modern life, and
flinching at nothing of the conventional. I think it might be
done with good effect. You said once that Tennyson had
done it in 'Locksley Hall,' and I half agreed with you. But
looking at 'Locksley Hall' again, I find that not much has
been done in that <i>way</i>, noble and passionate and <i>full</i> as the
poem is in other ways. But there is no story, no <i>manners</i>,
no modern allusion, except in the grand general adjuration
to the 'Mother-age,' and no approach to the treatment of a
conventionality. But Crabbe, as you say, has done it, and
Campbell in his 'Theodore' in a few touches was near to
do it; but <i>Hayley</i> clearly apprehends the species of poem
in his 'Triumphs of Temper' and 'Triumphs of Music,'
and so did Miss Seward, who called it the '<i>poetical novel</i>.'
Now I do think that a true poetical novel&mdash;modern, and on
the level of the manners of the day&mdash;might be as good a
poem as any other, and much more popular besides. Do
you not think so?</p>

<p>I had a letter from dear Miss Mitford this morning,
with yours, but I can find nothing in it that you will care
to hear again. She complains of the vagueness of
'Coningsby,' and praises the French writers&mdash;a sympathy
between us, that last, which we wear hidden in our sleeves
for the sake of propriety. Not a word of coming to
London, though I asked. Neither have I heard again from
Miss Martineau....</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately and gratefully yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
October 15, 1844.<br />

<p>... Not a word more have I heard from Miss Martineau;
and shall not soon, perhaps, as she is commanded not to
write, not to read&mdash;to do nothing, in fact, except the getting
better. I am not, I confess, quite satisfied myself. But
she herself appears to be so altogether, and she speaks of
'<i>symptoms</i> having given way,' implying a structural change.
Yes, I use the common phrase in respect to mesmerism,
and think 'there is something in it.' Only I think, besides,
that, if something, there must be a great deal in it. Clairvoyance
has precisely the same evidence as the phenomenon
of the trance has, and scientific and philosophical minds
are recognising all the phenomena <i>as facts</i> on all sides of
us. Mr. Kenyon's is the best distinction, and the immense
quantity of <i>humbug</i> which embroiders the truth over and
over, and round and round, makes it needful: 'I believe in
mesmerism, but not in <i>mesmerists</i>.'</p>

<p>We have had no other letter from our Egyptians, but
can wait a little longer without losing our patience.</p>

<p>The blind rises in favour, and the ivy would not fall,
if it would but live. Alas! I am going to try <i>guano</i> as a
last resource. You see, in painting the windows, papa was
forced to have it taken down, and the ivy that grows on
ruins and oaks is not usually taken down 'for the nonce.'
I think I shall have a myrtle grove in two or three large
pots inside the window. I have a mind to try it.</p>

<p>I heard twice from dear Mr. Kenyon at Dover, where
he was detained by the weather, but not since his entrance
into France. Which is grand enough word for the French
Majesty itself&mdash;'entrance into France.' By the way, I do
hope you have some sympathy with me in my respect for the
King of the French&mdash;that right kingly king, Louis Philippe.
If France had <i>borne</i> more liberty, he would not have withheld
it, and, for the rest, and in all truly royal qualities, he
is the noblest king, according to my idea, in Europe&mdash;the
most royal king in the encouragement of art and literature,
and in the honoring of artists and men of letters. Let
a young unknown writer accomplish a successful tragedy,
and the next day he sits at the king's table&mdash;not in a metaphor,
but face to face. See how different the matter is in
our court, where the artists are shown up the back stairs,
and where no poet (even by the back stairs) can penetrate,
unless so fortunate as to be a banker also. What is the use
of kings and queens in these days, except to encourage arts
and letters? Really I cannot see. Anybody can hunt an
otter out of a box&mdash;who has nerve enough.</p>

<p>I had a letter from America to-day, and heard that my
book was not published there until the fifth of this October.
Still, a few copies had preceded the publication, and made
way among the critics, and several reviews were in the
course of germinating very greenly. Yes, I was delighted
with the 'Examiner,' and all the more so from having
interpreted the long delay of the notice, the gloomiest
manner possible. My friends try to persuade me that the
book is making some impression, and I am willing enough
to be convinced. Thank you for all your kind sympathy,
my dear friend.</p>

<p>Now, do write to me soon again! Have you read
Dr. Arnold's Life? I have not, but am very anxious to do
so, from the admirable extracts in the 'Examiner' of last
Saturday, and also from what I hear of it in other quarters.
That Dr. Arnold must have been <i>a man</i>, in the largest and
noblest sense. May God bless you, both of you! I think
of you, dearest Mrs. Martin, much, and remain</p>

<p>Your very affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To John Kenyon</i><br />
Saturday, October 29, 1844.<br />

<p>The moral of your letter, my dearest cousin, certainly is
that no green herb of a secret will spring up and flourish
between you and me.</p>

<p>The loss of Flush was a secret. My aunt's intention of
coming to England (for I know not how to explain what
she said to you, but by the supposition of an unfulfilled
intention!) was a secret. And Mr. Chorley's letter to me
was a third secret. All turned into light!</p>

<p>For the last, you may well praise me for discretion.
The letter he wrote was pleasanter to me than many of
the kindnesses (apart from your own) occasioned by my
book&mdash;and when you asked me once 'what letters I had
received,' if ever a woman deserved to be canonised for
her silence, <i>I</i> did! But the effort was necessary&mdash;for he
particularly desired that I would not mention to 'our common
friends' the circumstance of his having written to me;
and 'common friends' could only stand for 'Mr. Kenyon
and Miss Mitford.' Of course what you tell me, of his
liking the poems better still, is delightful to hear; but he
reviewed them in the 'Athenaeum' surely! The review we
read in the 'Athenaeum' was by his hand&mdash;could not be
mistaken ...</p>

<p>Well; but Flushie! It is too true that he has been
lost&mdash;lost and won; and true besides that I was a good
deal upset by it <i>meo more</i>; and that I found it hard to eat
and sleep as usual while he was in the hands of his enemies.
It is a secret too. We would not tell papa of it. Papa
would have been angry with the unfortunate person who
took Flush out without a chain; and would have kicked
against the pricks of the necessary bribing of the thief in
order to the getting him back. Therefore we didn't tell
papa; and as I had a very bad convenient headache the
day my eyes were reddest, I did not see him (except once)
till Flush was on the sofa again. As to the thieves, you
are very kind to talk daggers at them; and I feel no
inclination to say 'Don't.' It is quite too bad and cruel.
And think of their exceeding insolence in taking Flush away
from this very door, while Arabel was waiting to have the
door opened on her return from her walk; and in observing
(as they gave him back for six guineas and a half) that they
intended to have him again at the earliest opportunity and
that <i>then</i> they must have <i>ten</i> guineas! I tell poor Flushie
(while he looks very earnestly in my face) that he and I
shall be ruined at last, and that I shall have no money to
buy him cakes; but the worst is the anxiety! Whether I
am particularly silly, or not, I don't know; they say here,
that I am; but it seems to me impossible for anybody who
really cares for a dog, to think quietly of his being in the
hands of those infamous men. And then I know how poor
Flushie must feel it. When he was brought home, he
began to cry in his manner, whine, as if his heart was full!
It was just what I was inclined to do myself&mdash;' and thus
was Flushie lost and won.'</p>

<p>But we are both recovered now, thank you; and intend
to be very prudent for the future. I am delighted to
think of your being in England; it is the next best thing
to your being in London. In regard to Miss Martineau,
I agree with you word for word; but I cannot overcome
an additional <i>horror</i>, which you do not express, or feel
probably.</p>

<p>There is an excellent refutation of Puseyism in the
'Edinburgh Review'&mdash;by whom? and I have been reading
besides the admirable paper by Macaulay in the same
number. And now I must be done; having resolved to
let you hear without a post's delay. Otherwise I might
have American news for you, as I hear that a packet has
come in.</p>

<p>My brothers arrived in great spirits at Malta, after a
<i>three weeks' voyage</i> from Gibraltar; and must now be in
Egypt, I think and trust.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear cousin.</p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: November 5, 1844.<br />

<p>Well, but am I really so bad? ' <i>Et tu</i>!' Can <i>you</i> call
me careless? Remember all the altering of manuscript
and proof&mdash;and remember how the obscurities used to fly
away before your cloud-compelling, when you were the
Jove of the criticisms! That the books (I won't call them
<i>our</i> books when I am speaking of the faults) are remarkable
for defects and superfluities of evil, I can see quite
as well as another; but then I won't admit that ' it comes'
of my carelessness, and refusing to take pains. On the
contrary, my belief is, that very few writers called ' correct '
who have selected classical models to work from, pay more
laborious attention than I do habitually to the forms of
thought and expression. ' Lady Geraldine ' was an exception
in her whole history. If I write fast sometimes
(and the historical fact is that what has been written fastest,
has pleased most), l am not apt to print without consideration.
I appeal to Philip sober, if I am! My dearest cousin, do
remember! As to the faults, I do not think of defending
them, be very sure. My consolation is, that I may try to
do better in time, if I may talk of time. The worst fault
of all, as far as expression goes (the adjective-substantives,
whether in prose or verse, I cannot make up my mind
to consider faulty), is that kind of obscurity which is the
same thing with inadequate expression. Be very sure&mdash;try
to be very sure&mdash;that I am not obstinate and self-opiniated
beyond measure. To <i>you</i> in case, who have done so
much for me, and who think of me so more than kindly, I
feel it to be both duty and pleasure to defer and yield.
Still, you know, we could not, if we were ten years about it,
alter down the poems to the terms of all these reviewers.
You would not desire it, if it were possible. I do not
remember that you suggested any change in the verse on
Aeschylus. The critic<a name="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> mistakes my allusion, which was
to the fact that in the acting of the Eumenides, when the
great tragic poet did actually 'frown as the gods did,'
women fell down fainting from the benches. I did not
refer to the effect of his human countenance 'during
composition.' But I am very grateful to the reviewer
whoever he may be&mdash;very&mdash;and with need. See how the
'Sun' shines in response to 'Blackwood' (thank you for
sending me that notice), when previously we had had but
a wintry rag from the same quarter! No; if I am not
spoilt by <i>your kindness</i>, I am not likely to be so by any of
these exoteric praises, however beyond what I expected or
deserved. And then I am like a bird with one wing broken.
Throw it out of the window; and after the first feeling of
pleasure in liberty, it falls heavily. I have had moments of
great pleasure in hearing whatever good has been thought
of the poems; but the feeling of <i>elation</i> is too strong or
rather too <i>long</i> for me....</p>

<p>Can it be true that Mr. Newman has at last joined the
Church of Rome?<a name="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> If it is true, it will do much to prove
to the most illogical minds the real character of the late
movement. It will prove what the <i>point of sight</i> is, as by
the drawing of a straight line. Miss Mitford told me that
he had lately sent a message to a R. Catholic convert
from the English Church, to the effect&mdash;'you have done
a good deed, but not at a right time.' It can but be a
question of time, indeed, to the whole party; at least to
such as are logical&mdash;and honest.... [<i>Unsigned</i>]</p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: November 8, 1844.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dear dear cousin, for the kind thought of
sending me Mr. Eagles's letter, and most for your own
note. You know we <i>both</i> saw that he couldn't have written
the paper in question; we <i>both</i> were poets and prophets by
that sign, but I hope he understands that I shall gratefully
remember what his intention was. As to his 'friend' who
told him that I had 'imitated Tennyson,' why I can only
say and feel that it is very particularly provoking to hear
such things said, and that I wish people would find fault
with my 'metre' in the place of them. In the matter of
'Geraldine' I shall not be puffed up. I shall take to mind
what you suggest. Of course, if you find it hard to read, it
must be my fault. And then the fact of there being a <i>story</i>
to a poem will give a factitious merit in the eyes of many
critics, which could not be an occasion of vainglory to the
consciousness of the most vainglorious of writers. You
made me smile by your suggestion about the aptitude of critics
aforesaid for courting Lady Geraldines. Certes&mdash;however
it may be&mdash;the poem has had more attention than its due.
Oh, and I must tell you that I had a letter the other day
from Mr. Westwood (one of my correspondents unknown)
referring to 'Blackwood,' and observing on the mistake about
Goethe. 'Did you not mean &quot;fell&quot; the verb,' he said, 'or
do <i>I</i> mistake?' So, you see, some people in the world did
actually understand what I meant. I am eager to prove
that possibility sometimes.</p>

<p>How full of life of mind Mr. Eagles's letter is. Such
letters always bring me to think of Harriet Martineau's
pestilent plan of doing to destruction half of the intellectual
life of the world, by suppressing every mental breath
breathed through the post office. She was not in a state of
clairvoyance when she said such a thing. I have not heard
from her, but you observed what the 'Critic' said of William
Howitt's being empowered by her to declare the circumstances
of her recovery?</p>

<p>Again and again have I sent for Dr. Arnold's 'Life,' and
I do hope to have it to-day. I am certain, by the extracts,
besides your opinion, that I shall be delighted with it.</p>

<p>Why shouldn't Miss Martineau's apocalyptic housemaid<a name="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>
tell us whether Flush has a soul, and what is its 'future
destination'? As to the fact of his soul, I have long had
a strong opinion on it. The 'grand peut-&ecirc;tre,' to which
'without revelation' the human argument is reduced, covers
dog-nature with the sweep of its fringes.</p>

<p>Did you ever read Bulwer's 'Eva, or the Unhappy
Marriage'? <i>That</i> is a sort of poetical novel, with modern
manners inclusive. But Bulwer, although a poet in prose,
writes all his rhythmetical compositions somewhat prosaically,
providing an instance of that curious difference which exists
between the poetical writer and the poet. It is easier to
give the instance than the reason, but I suppose the cause
of the rhythmetical impotence must lie somewhere in the
want of the power of concentration. For is it not true that
the most prolix poet is capable of briefer expression than
the least prolix prose writer, or am I wrong?...</p>

<i>To Cornelius Mathews</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: November 14, 1844.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Mathews,&mdash;I write to tell you&mdash;only that
there is nothing to tell&mdash;only in guard of my gratitude, lest
you should come to think all manner of evil of me and of
my supposed propensity to let everything pass like Mr.
Horne's copies of the American edition of his work, <i>sub
silentio</i>. Therefore I must write, and you are to please to
understand that I have not up to this moment received
either letter or book by the packet of October 10 which
was charged, according to your intimation, with so much.
I, being quite out of patience and out of breath with
expectation, have repeatedly sent to Mr. Putnam, and he
replies with undisturbed politeness that the ship has come
in, and that his part and lot in her, together with mine,
remain at the disposal of the Custom-house officers, and
may remain some time longer. So you see how it is. I am
waiting&mdash;simply <i>waiting</i>, and it is better to let you know
that I am not forgetting instead.</p>

<p>In the meantime, your kindness will be glad to learn of
the prosperity of my poems in my own country. I am more
than satisfied in my most sanguine hope for them, and a
little surprised besides. The critics have been good to me.
'Blackwood' and 'Tait' have this month both been generous,
and the 'New Monthly' and 'Ainsworth's Magazine' did
what they could. Then I have the 'Examiner' in my
favor, and such heads and hearts as are better and purer
than the purely critical, and I am very glad altogether, and
very grateful, and hope to live long enough to acknowledge,
if not to justify, much unexpected kindness. Of course,
some hard criticism is mixed with the liberal sympathy, as
you will see in 'Blackwood,' but some of it I deserve, even
in my own eyes; and all of it I am willing to be patient
under. The strange thing is, that without a single personal
friend among these critics, they should have expended on
me so much 'gentillesse,' and this strangeness I feel very
sensitively. Mr. Horne has not returned to England yet,
and in a letter which I received from him some fortnight
ago he desired to have my book sent to him to Germany,
just as if he never meant to return to England again. I
answered his sayings, and reiterated, in a way that would
make you smile, my information about your having sent the
American copies to him. I made my <i>oyez</i> very plain and
articulate. He won't say again that he never heard of it&mdash;be
sure of <i>that</i>. Well, and then Mr. Browning is not in
England either, so that whatever you send for <i>him</i> must
await his return from the east or the west or the south,
wherever he is. The new spirit of the age is a wandering
spirit. Mr. Dickens is in Italy. Even Miss Mitford <i>talks</i>
of going to France, which is an extreme case for <i>her</i>. Do
you never feel inclined to flash across the Atlantic to us, or
can you really remain still in one place?</p>

<p>I must not forget to assure you, dear Mr. Mathews, as I
may conscientiously do, even before I have looked into or
received the 'Democratic Review,' that whatever fault you
may find with me, my strongest feeling on reading your
article will or must be <i>the sense of your kindness</i>. Of course
I do not expect, nor should I wish, that your personal
interest in me (proved in so many ways) would destroy your
critical faculty in regard to me. Such an expectation, if I
had entertained it, would have been scarcely honorable to
either of us, and I may assure you that I never did entertain
it. No; be at rest about the article. It is not likely that
I shall think it 'inadequate.' And I may as well mention
in connection with it that before you spoke of reviewing me
<i>I</i> (in my despair of Mr. Horne's absence, and my impotency
to assist your book) had thrown into my desk, to watch
for some opportunity of publication, a review of your 'Poems
on Man,' from my own hand, and that I am still waiting
and considering and taking courage before I send it to
some current periodical. There is a difficulty&mdash;there is a
feeling of shyness on my part, because, as I told you, I have
no personal friend or introduction among the pressmen
or the critics, and because the 'Athenaeum,' which I should
otherwise turn to first, has already treated of your work, and
would not, of course, consent to reconsider an expressed
opinion. Well, I shall do it somewhere. Forgive me the
<i>appearance</i> of my impotency under a general aspect.</p>

<p>Ah, you cannot guess at the estate of poetry in the eyes
of even such poetical English publishers as Mr. Moxon,
who can write sonnets himself. Poetry is in their eyes just
a desperate speculation. A poet must have tried his public
before he tries the publisher&mdash;that is, before he expects the
publisher to run a risk for him. But I will make any effort
you like to suggest for any work of yours; I only tell you
how <i>things are</i>. By the way, if I ever told you that
Tennyson was ill, I may as rightly tell you now that he is
well, again, or was when I last heard of him. I do not
know him personally. Also Harriet Martineau can walk
five miles a day with ease, and believes in mesmerism with
all her strength. Mr. Putnam had the goodness to write
and open his reading room to me, who am in prison instead
in mine.</p>

<p>May God bless you. Do let me hear from you soon,
and believe me ever your friend,</p>

<p>E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
November 16, 1844.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin, ... To-day I perceive in the
'contents' of the new 'Westminster Review' that my poems
are reviewed in it, and I hope that you will both be interested
enough in my fortunes to read at the library what may be
said of them. Did George tell you that he imagined (as I
also did) the 'Blackwood' paper to be by Mr. Phillimore the
barrister? Well, Mr. Phillimore denies it altogether, has in
fact quarrelled with Christopher North, and writes no more
for him, so that I am quite at a loss now where to carry my
gratitude.</p>

<p>Do write to me soon. I hear that everybody should
read Dr. Arnold's 'Life.' Do you know also 'E&#333; then,' a work
of genius? You have read, perhaps, Hewitt's 'Visits to
Remarkable Places' in the first series and second; and
Mrs. Jameson's 'Visits and Sketches' and 'Life in Mexico.'
Do you know the 'Santa F&eacute; Expedition,' and Custine's
'Russia,' and 'Forest Life' by Mrs. Clavers? You will think
that my associative process is in a most disorderly state, by
all this running up and down the stairs of all sorts of subjects,
in the naming of books. I would write a list, more as a list
should be written, if I could see my way better, and this
will do for a beginning in any case. You do not like
romances, I believe, as I do, and then nearly every romance
now-a-days sets about pulling the joints of one's heart and
soul out, as a process of course. 'Ellen Middleton' (which I
have not read yet) is said to be very painful. Do you know
Leigh Hunt's exquisite essays called 'The Indicator and
Companion' &amp;c., published by Moxon? I hold them at
once in delight and reverence.
May God bless you both.</p>

<p>I am ever your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />



<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street:<br />
Tuesday, November 26, 1844 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I thank you much for your
little notes; and you know too well how my sympathy
answers you, 'as face to face in a glass,' for me to assure
you of it here. Your account of yourselves altogether I
take to be satisfactory, because I never expected anybody
to gain strength very <i>rapidly</i> while in the actual endurance
of hard medical discipline. I am glad you have found out
a trustworthy adviser at Dover, but I feel nevertheless that
you may <i>both trust</i> and <i>hope</i> in Dr. Bright, of whom I heard
the very highest praises the other day....</p>

<p>Now really I don't know why I should fancy you to
be so deeply interested in Dr. Bright, that all this detail
should be necessary. What I <i>do</i> want you to be interested in,
is in Miss Martineau's mesmeric experience,<a name="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> for a copy of
which, in the last 'Athenaeum,' I have sent ever since
yesterday, in the intention of sending it to you. You will
admit it to be curious as philosophy, and beautiful as
composition; for the rest, I will not answer. Believing in
mesmerism as an agency, I hesitate to assent to the necessary
connection between Miss Martineau's cure and the
power; and also I am of opinion that unbelievers will not
very generally become converts through her representations.
There is a tone of exaltation which will be observed upon,
and one or two sentences are suggestive to scepticism. I
will send it to you when I get the number. I understand
that an intimate friend of hers (a lady) travelled
down from the south of England to Tynemouth, simply to
try to prevent the public exposition, but could not prevail.
Mr. Milnes has, besides, been her visitor. He is fully a
believer, she says, and affirms to having seen the same
phenomena in the East, but regards the whole subject with
<i>horror</i>. This still appears to be Mrs. Jameson's feeling, as
you know it is mine. Mrs. Jameson came again to this
door with a note, and overcoming by kindness, was let in
on Saturday last; and sate with me for nearly an hour,
and so ran into what my sisters call 'one of my sudden
intimacies' that there was an embrace for a farewell. Of
course she won my affections through my vanity (Mr. Martin
will be sure to say, so I hasten to anticipate him) and by
exaggerations about my poetry; but really, and although my
heart beat itself almost to pieces for fear of seeing her as
she walked upstairs, I do think I should have liked her
<i>without the flattery</i>. She is very light&mdash;has the lightest
of eyes, the lightest of complexions; no eyebrows, and
what looked to me like very pale red hair, and thin
lips of no colour at all. But with all this indecision of
exterior the expression is rather acute than soft; and the
conversation in its principal characteristics, analytical and
examinative; throwing out no thought which is not as clear
as glass&mdash;critical, in fact, in somewhat of an austere sense. I
use 'austere,' of course, in its intellectual relation, for nothing
in the world could be kinder, or more graciously kind,
than her whole manner and words were to me. She is
coming again in two or three days, she says. Yes, and she
said of Miss Martineau's paper in the 'Athenaeum,' that she
very much doubted the wisdom of publishing it now; and
that for the public's sake, if not for her own, Miss M. should
have waited till the excitement of recovered health had a
little subsided. She said of mesmerism altogether that she
was inclined to believe it, but had not finally made up her
convictions. She used words so exactly like some I have
used myself that I must repeat them, 'that if there was <i>anything</i>
in it, there was <i>so much</i>, it became scarcely possible to
limit consequences, and the subject grew awful to contemplate.' ...</p>

<p>On Saturday I had some copies of my American edition,
which dazzle the English one; and one or two reviews,
transatlantically transcendental in 'oilie flatterie.' And I
heard yesterday from the English publisher Moxon, and he
was 'happy to tell me that the work was selling very well,'
and this without an inquiry on my part. To say the truth,
I was <i>afraid</i> to inquire. It is good news altogether. The
'Westminster Review' won't be out till next month.</p>

<p>Wordsworth is so excited about the railroad that his wife
persuaded him to go away to recover his serenity, but he has
returned raging worse than ever. He says that fifty
members of Parliament have promised him their opposition.
He is wrong, I think, but I also consider that if the people
remembered his genius and his age, and suspended the
obnoxious Act for a few years, they would be right....</p>

<p>May God bless you both.</p>

<p>Most affectionately yours,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To James Martin</i><br />
December 10, 1844.<br />

<p>I have been thinking of you, my dear Mr. Martin, more
and more the colder it has been, and had made up my
mind to write to-day, let me feel as dull as I might. So,
the vane only turns to <i>you</i> instead of to dearest Mrs. Martin
in consequence of your letter&mdash;your letter makes <i>that</i> difference.
I should have written to Dover in any case....</p>

<p>You are to know that Miss Martineau's mesmeric
experience is only peculiar as being Harriet Martineau's,
otherwise it exhibits the mere commonplaces of the agency.
You laugh, I see. I wish I could laugh too. I mean, I
seriously wish that I could disbelieve in the reality of the
power, which is in every way most repulsive to me....</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin is surprised at me and others on account
of our 'horror.' Surely it is a natural feeling, and she
would herself be liable to it if she were <i>more credulous</i>.
The agency seems to me like the shaking of the flood-gates
placed by the Divine Creator between the unprepared soul
and the unseen world. Then&mdash;the subjection of the will
and vital powers of one individual to those of another, to
the extent of the apparent solution of the very identity, is
abhorrent from me. And then (as to the expediency of
the matter, and to prove how far believers may be carried)
there is even now a religious sect at Cheltenham, of persons
who call themselves advocates of the 'third revelation,'
and profess to receive their system of theology entirely from
patients in the sleep.</p>

<p>In the meantime, poor Miss Martineau, as the consequence
of her desire to speak the truth as she apprehends
it, is overwhelmed with atrocious insults from all quarters.
For my own part I would rather fall into the hands of God
than of man, and suffer as she did in the body, instead of
being the mark of these cruel observations. But she has
singular strength of mind, and calmly continues her testimony.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford writes to me: 'Be sure it is <i>all true</i>. I
see it every day in my Jane'&mdash;her maid, who is mesmerised
for deafness, but not, I believe, with much success curatively.
As a remedy, the success has been far greater in the
Martineau case than in others. With Miss Mitford's maid,
the sleep is, however, produced; and the girl professed, at
the third <i>s&eacute;ance</i>, to be able to <i>see behind her</i>.</p>

<p>I am glad I have so much interesting matter to look
forward to in the 'Eldon Memoirs' as Pincher's biography.
I am only in the first volume. Are English chancellors
really made of such stuff? I couldn't have thought it.
Pincher will help to reconcile me to the Law Lords perhaps.</p>

<p>And, to turn from Tory legislators, I am vainglorious
in announcing to you that the Anti-Corn-Law League has
taken up my poems on the top of its pikes as antithetic to
'War and Monopoly.' Have I not had a sonnet from
Gutter Lane? And has not the journal called the 'League'
reviewed me into the third heaven, high up&mdash;above the pure
ether of the five points? Yes, indeed. Of course I should
be a (magna) chartist for evermore, even without the
previous predilection.</p>

<p>And what do you and Mrs. Martin say about O'Connell?
Did you read last Saturday's 'Examiner'? Tell her that I
welcomed her kind letter heartily, and that this is an answer
to both of you. My best love to her always. May God
bless you, dear Mr. Martin! Probably I have written your
patience to an end. If papa or anybody were in the room,
I should have a remembrance for you.</p>

<p>I remain, myself,</p>

<p>Affectionately yours,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Wednesday [December 1844].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Hardly had my letter gone to
you yesterday, when your kind present and not <i>et</i> arrived. I
thank you for my boots with more than the warmth of the
worsted, and feel all their merits to my soul (each sole)
while I thank you. A pair of boots or shoes which 'can't
be kicked off' is something highly desirable for me, in
Wilson's opinion; and this is the first thing which struck
<i>her</i>. But the 'great idea' '&agrave; propos des bottes,' which
occurred to myself, ought to be unspeakable, like Miss
Martineau's great ideas&mdash;for I do believe it was&mdash;that I
needn't have the trouble every morning, <i>now</i>, of putting on
my stockings....</p>

<p>My voice is thawing too, with all the rest. If the cold
had lasted I should have been dumb in a day or two more,
and as it was, I was forced to refuse to see Mrs. Jameson
(who had the goodness to come again) because I couldn't
speak much above my breath. But I was tolerably well
and brave upon the whole. Oh, these murderous English
winters. The wonder is, how anybody can live through

<p>Did I tell you, or Mr. Martin, that Rogers the poet, at
eighty-three or four years of age, bore the bank robbery<a name="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>
with the light-hearted bearing of a man 'young and bold,'
went out to dinner two or three times the same week, and
said witty things on his own griefs. One of the other
partners went to bed instead, and was not likely, I heard,
to 'get over it.' I felt quite glad and proud for Rogers.
He was in Germany last year, and this summer in Paris;
but he <i>first</i> went to see Wordsworth at the Lakes.</p>

<p>It is a fine thing when a light burns so clear down into
the socket, isn't it? I, who am not a devout admirer of
the 'Pleasures of Memory,' do admire this perpetual youth
and untired energy; it is a fine thing to my mind. Then,
there are other noble characteristics about this Rogers. A
common friend said the other day to Mr. Kenyon, 'Rogers
hates me, I know. He is always saying bitter speeches in
relation to me, and yesterday he said so and so. <i>But</i>,'
he continued, 'if I were in distress, there is one man in the
world to whom I would go without doubt and without hesitation,
at once, and as to a brother, and <i>that</i> man is <i>Rogers</i>.' Not
that I would choose to be obliged to a man who hated me;
but it is an illustration of the fact that if Rogers is bitter in
his words, which we all know he is, he is always benevolent
and generous in his deeds. He makes an epigram on a
man, and gives him a thousand pounds; and the deed is
the truer expression of his own nature. An uncommon
development of character, in any case.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you, in an antithesis, of the popularising
of my poems. I had a sonnet the other day from
Gutter Lane, Cheapside, and I heard that Count d'Orsay
had written one of the stanzas of 'Crowned and Buried'
at the bottom of an engraving of Napoleon which hangs in
his room. Now I allow you to laugh at my vaingloriousness,
and then you may pin it to Mrs. Best's satisfaction in the
dedication to Dowager Majesty. By the way&mdash;no, out of
the way&mdash;it is whispered that when Queen Victoria goes to
Strathfieldsea<a name="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> (how do you spell it?) she means to visit
Miss Mitford, to which rumour Miss Mitford (being that
rare creature, a sensible woman) says: 'May God forbid.'</p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Wednesday morning [about December 1844].<br />

<p>I thank you, my dear cousin, and did so silently the
day before yesterday, when you were kind enough to bring
me the review and write the good news in pencil. I should
be delighted to see you (this is to certify) notwithstanding
the frost; only my voice having suffered, and being the
ghost of itself, you might find it difficult to <i>hear</i> me without
inconvenience. Which is for <i>you</i> to consider, and not for
<i>me</i>. And indeed the fog, in addition to the cold, makes
it inexpedient for anyone to leave the house except upon
business and compulsion.</p>

<p>Oh no&mdash;we need not mind any scorn which assails
Tennyson and <i>us</i> together. There is a dishonor that
does honor&mdash;and 'this is of it.' I never heard of Barnes.<a name="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p>Were you aware that the review you brought was in
a newspaper called the 'League,' and laudatory to the
utmost extravagance&mdash;praising us too for courage in opposing
'war and monopoly'?&mdash;the 'corn ships in the offing'
being duly named. I have heard that it is probably written
by Mr. Cobden himself, who writes for the journal in
question, and is an enthusiast in poetry. If I thought so
to the point of conviction, <i>do you know, I should be very
much pleased</i>? You remember that I am a sort of (magna)
chartist&mdash;only going a little farther!</p>

<p>Flush was properly ashamed of himself when he came
upstairs again for his most ungrateful, inexplicable conduct
towards you; and I lectured him well; and upon asking
him to 'promise never to behave ill to you again,' he kissed
my hands and wagged his tail most emphatically. It
altogether amounted to an oath, I think. The truth is that
Flush's nervous system rather than his temper was in fault,
and that, in that great cloak, he saw you as in a cloudy
mystery. And then, when you stumbled over the bell
rope, he thought the world was come to an end. He is
not accustomed, you see, to the vicissitudes of life. Try
to forgive him and me&mdash;for his ingratitude seems to 'strike
through' to me; and I am not without remorse.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>I inclose Mr. Chorley's note which you left behind you,
but which I did not see until just now. <i>You</i> know that I
am not ashamed of '<i>progress</i>.' On the contrary, my only
hope is in it. But the question is not <i>there</i>, nor, I think,
for the public, except in cases of ripe, established reputations,
as I said before.</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
(On returning some illustrations of Spenser by Mr. Woods)<br />
December 11, 1844.<br />

<p>... With many thanks, cordial and true, I thank you
for the pleasure I have enjoyed in connection with these
proofs of genius. To be honest, it is my own personal
opinion (I give it to you for as much as it is worth&mdash;not
much!) that many of the subjects of these drawings are
unfit for graphic representation. What we can bear to see
in the poet's vision, and sustained on the wings of his
divine music, we shrink from a little when brought face
to face with, as drawn out in black and white. You will
understand what I mean. The horror and terror preponderate
in the drawings, and what is sublime in the poet
is apt to be extravagant in the artist&mdash;and this, not from
a deficiency of power in the latter, but from a treading on
ground forbidden except to the poet's foot. I may be
wrong, perhaps&mdash;I do not pretend to be right. I only tell
you (as you ask for them) what my impressions are.</p>

<p>I need not say that I wish all manner of success to your
friend the artist, and laurels of the weight of gold while of
the freshness of grass&mdash;alas! an impossible vegetable!&mdash;fabulous
as the Halcyon!</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Monday, December 24, 1844 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;I wish I had a note from you
to-day&mdash;which optative aorist I am not sure of being either
grammatical or reasonable! Perhaps you have expected
to hear from <i>me</i> with more reason....</p>

<p>I fancied that you would be struck by Miss Martineau's
lucid and able style. She is a very admirable woman&mdash;and
the most logical intellect of the age, for a woman.
On this account it is that the men throw stones at her,
and that many of her own sex throw dirt; but if I begin
on this subject I shall end by gnashing my teeth. A
righteous indignation fastens on me. I had a note from
her the other day, written in a noble spirit, and saying,
in reference to the insults lavished on her, that she was
prepared from the first for <i>publicity</i>, and ventured it all
for the sake of what she considered the truth&mdash;she was
sustained, she said, by the recollection of Godiva.</p>

<p>Do you remember who Godiva was&mdash;or shall I tell
you? Think of it&mdash;Godiva of Coventry, and peeping
Tom. The worst and basest is, that in this nineteenth
century there are thousands of Toms to one.</p>

<p>I think, however, myself, and with all my admiration
for Miss Martineau, that her statement and her reasonings
on it are not free from vagueness and apparent contradictions.
She writes in a state of enthusiasm, and some of
her expressions are naturally coloured by her mood of mind
and nerve.</p>

<p>May this Christmas give you ease and pleasantness,
in various ways, my dearest friend! My Christmas wish
for myself is to hear that you are well. I cannot bear to
think of you suffering. Are the nights better? May God
bless you. Shall you not think it a great thing if the poems
go into a second edition within the twelvemonth? I am
surprised at your not being satisfied. Consider what poetry
is, and that four months have not passed since the publication
of mine; and that, where poems have to make their
way by force of <i>themselves</i>, and not of name nor of fashion,
the first three months cannot present the period of the
quickest sale. That must be for afterwards. Think of me
on Christmas Day, as of one who gratefully loves you.</p>

<p>A passing reference in a previous letter (above, p. 217)
has told of the beginning of another friendship, which was to
hold a large place in Miss Barrett's later life; and the next
letter is the first now extant which was written to this new
friend, Anna Jameson. Mrs. Jameson had not at this
time written the works on sacred art with which her name
is now chiefly associated; but she was already engaged
in her long struggle to earn her livelihood by her pen.
Her first work, 'The Diary of an Ennuy&eacute;e' (1826), written
before her marriage, had attracted considerable attention.
Since then she had written her 'Characteristics of Women,'
'Essays on Shakespeare's Female Characters,' 'Visits and
Sketches,' and a number of compilations of less importance.
Quite recently she had been engaged to write handbooks
to the public and private art galleries of London, and had
so embarked on the career of art authorship in which her
best work was done.</p>

<p>The beginning and end of the following letter are lost.
The subject of it is the long and hostile comment which
appeared in the 'Athenaeum' for December 28 on Miss
Martineau's letters on mesmerism.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
[End of December 1844.]<br />

<p>... For the 'Athenaeum,' I have always held it as a
journal, first&mdash;in the very first rank&mdash;both in ability and
integrity; and knowing Mr. Dilke <i>is</i> the 'Athenaeum,' I
could make no mistake in my estimation of himself. I have
personal reasons for gratitude to both him and his journal,
and I have always felt that it was honorable to me to have
them. Also, I do not at all think that because a woman is
a woman, she is on that account to be spared the ordinary
risks of the arena in literature and philosophy. I think no
such thing. Logical chivalry would be still more radically
debasing to us than any other. It is not therefore at all as
a Harriet Martineau, but as a thinking and feeling Martineau
(now <i>don't</i> laugh), that I hold her to have been hardly used
in the late controversy. And, if you don't laugh at <i>that</i>,
don't be too grave either, with the thought of your own
share and position in the matter; because, as must be
obvious to everyone (yourself included), you did everything
possible to you to prevent the catastrophe, and no man and
no friend could have done better. My brother George told
me of his conversation with you at Mr. Lough's, but <i>are</i>
you not mistaken in fancying that she blames you, that she
is cold with you? I really think you must be. Why, if she
is displeased with you she must be unjust, <i>and is she ever
unjust</i>? I ask you. <i>I</i> should imagine not, but then,
with all my insolence of talking of her as my friend, I only
admire and love her at a distance, in her books and in her
letters, and do not know her face to face, and in living
womanhood at all. She wrote to me once, and since we have
corresponded; and as in her kindness she has called me her
friend, I leap hastily at an unripe fruit, perhaps, and echo
back the word. She is your friend in a completer, or, at
least, a more ordinary sense; and indeed it is impossible
for me to believe without strong evidence that she could
cease to be your friend on such grounds as are apparent.
Perhaps she does not write because she cannot contain her
wrath against Mr. Dilke (which, between ourselves, she cannot,
very well), and respects your connection and regard for
him. Is not <i>that</i> a 'peradventure' worth considering? I
am sure that you have no <i>right</i> to be uneasy in any case.</p>

<p>And now I do not like to send you this letter without
telling you my impression about mesmerism, lest I seem
reserved and 'afraid of committing myself,' as prudent
people are. I will confess, then, that my <i>impression</i> is in
favour of the reality of mesmerism to some unknown extent.
I particularly dislike believing it, I would rather believe
most other things in the world; but the evidence of the
'cloud of witnesses' does thunder and lightning so in my
ears and eyes, that I believe, while my blood runs cold. I
would not be practised upon&mdash;no, not for one of Flushie's
ears, and I hate the whole theory. It is hideous to my
imagination, especially what is called phrenological mesmerism.
After all, however, truth is to be accepted; and
testimony, when so various and decisive, is an ascertainer
of truth. Now do not tell Mr. Dilke, lest he excommunicate
me.</p>

<p>But I will not pity you for the increase of occupation
produced by an increase of such comfort as your mother's
and sister's presence must give. What it will be for you to
have a branch to sun yourself on, after a long flight against
the wind!</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: January 3, 1845.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Chorley,&mdash;I hope it will not be transgressing
very much against the etiquette of journalism, or against the
individual delicacy which is of more consequence to both of
us, if I venture to thank you by one word for the pages
which relate to me in your excellent article in the 'New
Quarterly.' It is not my habit to thank or to remonstrate
with my reviewers, and indeed I believe I may tell you that
I never wrote to thank anyone before on these grounds. I
could not thank anyone for praising me&mdash;I would not thank
him for praising me against his conscience; and if he
praised me to the measure of his conscience only, I should
have little (as far as the praise went) to thank him for.
Therefore I do not thank you for the praise in your article,
but for the kind cordial spirit which pervades both praise
and blame, for the willingness in praising, and for the gentleness
in finding fault; for the encouragement without
unseemly exaggeration, and for the criticisms without
critical scorn. Allow me to thank you for these things and
for the pleasure I have received by their means. I am bold
to do it, because I hear that you confess the reviewership;
and am the bolder, because I recognised your hand in an
act of somewhat similar kindness in the 'Athenaeum' at the
first appearance of the poems.</p>

<p>While I am writing of the 'New Quarterly,' I take the
liberty of making a remark, not of course in relation to
myself&mdash;I know too well my duty to my judges&mdash;but to your
view of the Vantage ground of the poetesses of England.
It is a strong impression with me that previous to Joanna
Baillie there was no such thing in England as a poetess;
and that so far from triumphing over the rest of the world
in that particular product, we lay until then under the feet
of the world. We hear of a Marie in Brittany who sang
songs worthy to be mixed with Chaucer's for true poetic
sweetness, and in Italy a Vittoria Colonna sang her noble
sonnets. But in England, where is our poetess before
Joanna Baillie&mdash;poetess in the true sense? Lady Winchilsea
had an <i>eye</i>, as Wordsworth found out; but the Duchess of
Newcastle had more poetry in her&mdash;the comparative praise
proving the negative position&mdash;than Lady Winchilsea. And
when you say of the French, that they have only epistolary
women and wits, while we have our Lady Mary, why what
would Lady Mary be to us <i>but</i> for her letters and her wit?
Not a poetess, surely! unless we accept for poetry her
graceful <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>Do forgive me if an impulse has carried me too far. It
has been long 'a fact,' to my view of the matter, that
Joanna Baillie is the first female poet in all senses in
England; and I fell with the whole weight of fact and theory
against the edge of your article.</p>

<p>I recall myself now to my first intention of being simply,
but not silently, grateful to you; and entreating you to
pardon this letter too quickly to think it necessary-to
answer it....</p>

<p>I remain, very truly yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: January 7, 1845.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Chorley,&mdash;You are very good to deign to
answer my impertinences, and not to be disgusted by my
defamations of 'the grandmothers,' and (to diminish my
perversity in your eyes) I am ready to admit at once that we
are generally too apt to run into premature classification&mdash;the
error of all imperfect knowledge; and into unreasonable
exclusiveness&mdash;the vice of it. We spoil the shining surface
of life by our black lines drawn through and through, as if
ominously for a game of the fox and goose. For my part,
however imperfect my practice may be, I am intimately
convinced&mdash;and more and more since my long seclusion&mdash;that
to live in a house with windows on every side, so as to
catch both the morning and evening sunshine, is the best and
brightest thing we have to do&mdash;to say nothing about the
justest and wisest. Sympathies are our opportunities of good.</p>

<p>Moreover, I know nothing of your 'sweet mistress
Anne.'<a name="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> I never read a verse of hers. Ignorance goes for
much, you see, in all our mal-criticisms, and my ignorance
goes to this extent. I cannot write to you of your Anglo-American
poetess.</p>

<p>Also, in my sweeping speech about the grandmothers, I
should have stopped before such instances as the exquisite
ballad of 'Auld Robin Gray,' which is attributed to a
woman, and the pathetic 'Ballow my Babe,' which tradition
calls 'Lady Anne Bothwell's Lament.' I have certain
doubts of my own, indeed, in relation to both origins, and
with regard to 'Robin Gray' in particular; but doubts are
not worthy stuff enough to be taken into an argument, and
certainly, therefore, I should have admitted those two
ballads as worthy poems before the <i>Joannan aera</i>.</p>

<p>For what I ventured to say otherwise, would you not
consent to join our sympathies, and receive the 'choir'
(ah! but you are very cunningly subtle in your distinctions;
I am afraid I was too simple for you) as agreeable writers
of verses sometimes, leaving the word <i>poet</i> alone? Because,
you see, what you call the 'bad dispensation' by no means
accounts for the want of the faculty of poetry, strictly so
called. England has had many learned women, not merely
readers but writers of the learned languages, in Elizabeth's
time and afterwards&mdash;women of deeper acquirements than
are common now in the greater diffusion of letters; and
yet where were the poetesses? The divine breath which
seemed to come and go, and, ere it went, filled the land with
that crowd of true poets whom we call the old dramatists&mdash;why
did it never pass, even in the lyrical form, over the
lips of a woman? How strange! And can we deny that
it was so? I look everywhere for grandmothers and see
none. It is not in the filial spirit I am deficient, I do assure
you&mdash;witness my reverent love of the grandfathers!</p>

<p>Seriously, I do not presume to enter into argument with
you, and this in relation to a critical paper which I admire
in so many ways and am grateful for in some; but is not
the poet a different man from the cleverest versifier, and is
it not well for the world to be taught the difference? The
divineness of poetry is far more to me than either pride of
sex or personal pride, and, though willing to acknowledge
the lowest breath of the inspiration, I cannot the 'powder
and patch.' As powder and patch I may, but not as poetry.
And though I in turn may suffer for this myself&mdash;though I
too (<i>anch' io</i>) may be turned out of 'Arcadia,' and told that
I am not a poet, still, I should be content, I hope, that the
divineness of poetry be proved in my humanness, rather
than lowered to my uses.</p>

<p>But you shall not think me exclusive. Of poor L.E.L.,
for instance, I could write with <i>more</i> praiseful appreciation
than you can. It appears to me that she had the gift&mdash;though
in certain respects she dishonored the art&mdash;and
her latter lyrics are, many of them, of great beauty and
melody, such as, having once touched the ear of a reader,
live on in it. I observe in your 'Life of Mrs. Hemans'
(shall I tell you how often I have read those volumes?) she
(Mrs. H.) never appears, in any given letter or recorded
opinion, to esteem her contemporary. The antagonism lay,
probably, in the higher parts of Mrs. Hemans's character
and mind, and we are not to wonder at it.</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to me to have your approbation of
the sonnets on George Sand, on the points of feeling and
lightness, on which all my readers have not absolved me
equally, I have reason to know. I am more a latitudinarian
in literature than it is generally thought expedient for
women to be; and I have that admiration for <i>genius</i>, which
dear Mr. Kenyon calls my 'immoral sympathy with power;'
and if Madame Dudevant<a name="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> is not the first female genius of
any country or age, I really do not know who is. And
then she has certain noblenesses&mdash;granting all the evil and
'perilous stuff'&mdash;noblenesses and royalnesses which make
me loyal. Do pardon me for intruding all this on you,
though you cannot justify me&mdash;<i>you</i>, who are occupied
beyond measure, and <i>I</i>, who know it! I have been under
the delusion, too, during this writing, of having something
like a friend's claim to write and be troublesome. I have
lived so near your friends that I keep the odour of them!
A mere delusion, alas! my only personal right in respect to
you being one that I am not likely to forget or waive&mdash;the
right of being grateful to you.</p>

<p>But so, and looking again at the last words of your letter,
I see that you 'wish,' in the kindest of words, 'to do something
more for me.' I hope some day to take this 'something
more' of your kindness out in the pleasure of personal
intercourse; and if, in the meantime, you should consent
to flatter my delusion by letting me hear from you now
and then, if ever you have a moment to waste and inclination
to waste it, why I, on my side, shall always be ready to
thank you for the 'something more' of kindness, as bound
in the duty of gratitude. In any case I remain</p>

<p>Truly and faithfully yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
[<i>The beginning of this letter is lost</i>]<br />
[1845]<br />

<p>... to the awful consideration of the possibility of my
reading a novel or caring for the story of it (<i>proh pudor!</i>),
that I am probably, not to say certainly, the most complete
and unscrupulous romance reader within your knowledge.
Never was a child who cared more for 'a story' than I do;
never even did I myself, <i>as</i> a child, care more for it than I
do. My love of fiction began with my breath, and will end
with it; and goes on increasing; and the heights and
depths of the consumption which it has induced you may
guess at perhaps, but it is a sublime idea from its vastness,
and will gain on you but slowly. On my tombstone may
be written '<i>Ci-g&icirc;t</i> the greatest novel reader in the world,'
and nobody will forbid the inscription; and I approve of
Gray's notion of paradise more than of his lyrics, when he
suggests the   new, &#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#945;&#962; [eis tous
ai&ocirc;nas]. Are you shocked at me? Perhaps so. And you see I
make no excuses, as an invalid might. Invalid or not, I
should have a romance in a drawer, if not behind a pillow,
and I might as well be true and say so. There is the love
of literature, which is one thing, and the love of fiction,
which is another. And then, I am not fastidious, as Mrs.
Hemans was, in her high purity, and therefore the two
loves have a race-course clear.</p>

<p>This is a long preface to coming to speak of the
'Improvisatore.'<a name="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> I had sent for it already to the library,
and shall dun them for it twice as much for the sake of
what you say. Only I hope I may care for the story. I
shall try.</p>

<p>And for the <i>rococo</i>, I have more feeling for it, in a sense,
than I once had, for, some two years ago, I passed through
a long dynasty of French memoirs, which made me feel
quite differently about the littlenesses of greatnesses. I
measured them all from the heights of the 'tabouret,'<a name="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> and
was a good Duchess, in the 'non-natural' meaning, for
the moment. Those memoirs are charming of their kind,
and if life were cut in filagree paper would be profitable
reading to the soul. Do you not think so? And you
mean besides, probably, that you care for <i>beauty in detail</i>,
which we all should do if our senses were better educated.</p>

<p>So the confession is not a dreadful one, after all, and
mine may involve more evil, and would to ninety-nine
out of a hundred 'sensible and cultivated people.' Think
what Mrs. Ellis would say to the 'Women of England'
about me in her fifteenth edition, if she knew!</p>

<p>And do <i>you</i> know that dear Miss Mitford spent this
day week with me, notwithstanding the rain?</p>

<p>Very truly yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>I have forgotten what I particularly wished to say&mdash;viz.
that I never thought of <i>expecting</i> to hear from you. I
understand that when you write it is pure grace, and never
to be expected. You have too much to do, I understand
perfectly.</p>

<p>The east wind seems to be blowing all my letters about
to-day; the <i>t's</i> and <i>e's</i> wave like willows. Now if crooked
<i>e's</i> mean a 'greenshade' (not taken rurally), what awful
significance can have the whole crooked alphabet?</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Saturday, January 1844 [should be 1845].<a name="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a><br />

<p>I must tell you, my dearest Mrs. Martin, Mr. Kenyon
has read to me an extract from a private letter addressed
by H. Martineau to Moxon the publisher, to the effect that
Lord Morpeth was down on his knees in the middle of the
room a few nights ago, in the presence of the somnambule
J., and conversing with her in Greek and Latin, that the
four Miss Liddels were also present, and that they five
talked to her during one <i>s&eacute;ance</i> in five foreign languages,
viz. Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and German. When
the mesmeriser touches the organ of <i>imitation</i> on J.'s head,
while the strange tongue is in the course of being addressed
to her, she translates into English word for word what is
said; but when the organ of <i>language</i> is touched, she simply
answers in English what is said.</p>

<p>My 'few words of comment' upon this are, that I feel
to be more and more standing on my head&mdash;which does
not mean, you will be pleased to observe, that I understand.</p>

<p>Well, and how are you both going on? My voice is
quite returned; and papa continues, I am sorry to say, to
have a bad cold and cough. He means to stay in the
house to-day and try what prudence will do.</p>

<p>We have heard from Henry, at Alexandria still, but a
few days before sailing, and he and Stormie are bringing
home, as a companion to Flushie, a beautiful little gazelle.
What do you think of it? I would rather have it than the
'babby,' though the flourish of trumpets on the part of the
possessors seems quite in favor of the latter.</p>

<p>And I had a letter from Browning the poet last night,
which threw me into ecstasies&mdash;Browning, the author of
'Paracelsus,' and king of the mystics.</p>

<p>[<i>The rest of this letter is missing</i>.]</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Saturday, January 1845.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I believe our last letters
crossed, and we might draw lots for the turn of receiving
one, so that you are to take it for supererogatory virtue in
me altogether if I begin to write to you as 'at these presents.'
But I want to know how you both are, and if your last
account may continue to be considered the true one. You
have been poising yourself on the equal balance of letters,
as weak consciences are apt to do, but I write that you may
write, and also, a little, that I may thank you for the
kindness of your last letter, which was so very kind.</p>

<p>No, indeed, dearest Mrs. Martin. If I do not say oftener
that I have a strong and grateful trust in your affection for
me, and therefore in your interest in all that concerns me,
it is not that it is less strong and grateful. What I said or
sang of Miss Martineau's letter was no consequence of a
distrust of <i>you</i>, but of a feeling within myself that for me
to show about such a letter was scarcely becoming, and, in
the matter of modesty, nowise discreet. I suppose I was
writing excuses to myself for showing it to you. I cannot
otherwise account for the saying and singing. And, for the
rest, nobody can say or sing that I am not frank enough to
you&mdash;to the extent of telling all manner of nonsense about
myself which can only be supposed to be interesting on the
ground of your being presupposed to care a little for the
person concerned. Now am I not frank enough? And
by the way, I send you 'The Seraphim'<a name="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> at last, by this
day's railroad.</p>

<p>Thursday.</p>

<p>To prove to you that I had not forgotten you before
your letter came, here is the fragment of an unfinished one
which I send you, to begin with&mdash;an imperfect fossil letter,
which no comparative anatomy will bring much sense out
of&mdash;except the plain fact <i>that you were not forgotten</i>....</p>

<p>From Alexandria we heard yesterday that they sailed
from thence on the first of January, and the home passage
may be long.</p>

<p>The <i>changes</i> in Mary Minto on account of mesmerism
were merely imaginary as far as I can understand. Nobody
here observed any change in her. Oh no. These things
will be fancied sometimes. That she is an enthusiastic
girl, and that the subject took strong hold upon her, is true
enough, and not the least in the world&mdash;according to my
mind&mdash;to be wondered at. By the way, I had a letter
and the present of a work on mesmerism&mdash;Mr. Newnham's&mdash;from
his daughter, who sent it to me the other day, in
the kindest way, 'out of gratitude for my poetry,' as she
says, and from a desire that it might do me physical good
in the matter of health. I do not at all know her. I wrote
to thank her, of course, for the kindness and sympathy
which, as she expressed them, quite touched me; and to
explain how I did not stand in reach just now of the
temptations of mesmerism. I might have said that I
shrank nearly as much from these 'temptations' as from
Lord Bacon's stew of infant children for the purposes of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Well, then, I am getting deeper and deeper into correspondence
with Robert Browning, poet and mystic, and we
are growing to be the truest of friends. If I live a little
longer shut up in this room, I shall certainly know everybody
in the world. Mrs. Jameson came again yesterday,
and was very agreeable, but tried vainly to convince me
that the 'Vestiges of Creation,' which I take to be one of
the most melancholy books in the world, is the most
comforting, and that Lady Byron was an angel of a wife.
I persisted (in relation to the former clause) in a 'determinate
counsel' not to be a fully developed monkey if I could
help it, but when Mrs. J. assured me that she knew all the
circumstances of the separation, though she could not
betray a confidence, and entreated me 'to keep my mind
open' on a subject which would one day be set in the light,
I stroked down my feathers as well as I could, and listened
to reason. You know&mdash;or perhaps you do <i>not</i> know&mdash;that
there are two women whom I have hated all my life long&mdash;<i>Lady
Byron and Marie Louise</i>. To prove how false the
public effigy of the former is, however, Mrs. Jameson told
me that she knew <i>nothing of mathematics, nothing of science</i>,
and that the element preponderating in her mind is the
<i>poetical</i> element&mdash;that she cares much for <i>my</i> poetry! How
deep in the knowledge of the depths of vanity must
Mrs. J. be, to tell me <i>that</i>&mdash;now mustn't she? But there
was&mdash;yes, and is&mdash;a strong adverse feeling to work upon,
and it is not worked away.</p>

<p>Then, I have seen a copy of a note of Lord Morpeth
to H. Martineau, to the effect that he considered the
mesmeric phenomena witnessed by him (inclusive, remember,
of the <i>languages</i>) to be 'equally beautiful, wonderful,
and <i>undeniable</i>' but he is prudent enough to desire that no
use should be made of this letter ... And now no more
for to-day.</p>

<p>With love to Mr. Martin, ever believe me<br />
Your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Saturday, February 8, 1845.<br />

<p>I return to you, dearest Mr. Kenyon, the two numbers
of Jerold Douglas's<a name="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> magazine, and I wish 'by that same
sign' I could invoke your presence and advice on a letter I
received this morning. You never would guess what it is,
and you will wonder when I tell you that it offers a request
from the <i>Leeds Ladies' Committee</i>, authorised and backed
by the London <i>General Council of the League</i>, to your
cousin Ba, that she would write them a poem for the Corn
Law Bazaar to be holden at Covent Garden next May.
Now my heart is with the cause, and my vanity besides,
perhaps, for I do not deny that I am pleased with the
request so made, and if left to myself I should be likely at
once to say 'yes,' and write an agricultural-evil poem to
complete the factory-evil poem into a national-evil circle.
And I do not myself see how it would be implicating my name
with a political party to the extent of wearing a badge.
The League is not a party, but 'the meeting of the waters'
of several parties, and I am trying to persuade papa's
Whiggery that I may make a poem which will be a fair
exponent of the actual grievance, leaving the remedy free
for the hands of fixed-duty men like him, or free-trade
women like myself. As to wearing the badge of a party,
either in politics or religion, I may say that never in my life
was I so far from coveting such a thing. And then poetry
breathes in another outer air. And then there is not an
existent set of any-kind-of-politics I could agree with if I
tried&mdash;<i>I</i>, who am a sort of fossil republican! You shall see
the letters when you come. Remember what the 'League'
newspaper said of the 'Cry of the Children.'</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Miss Commeline</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: [February-March 1845].<br />

<p>My dear Miss Commeline,&mdash;I do hope that you will
allow me to appear to remember you as I never have ceased
to do in reality, and at a time when sympathy of friends is
generally acceptable, to offer you mine as if I had some
right of friendship to do so. And I am encouraged the more
to attempt this because I never shall forget that in the hour
of the bitterest agony of my life your brother wrote me a
letter which, although I did not read it, I was too ill and
distracted, I was yet shown the outside of some months
afterwards and enabled to appreciate the sympathy fully.
Such a kindness could not fail to keep alive in me (if the
need of keeping alive <i>were</i>!) the memory of the various kindnesses
received by me and mine from all your family, nor fail
to excite me to desire to impress upon you my remembrance
of <i>you</i> and my regard, and the interest with which I hear of
your joys and sorrows whenever they are large enough to be
seen from such a distance. Try to believe this of me,
dear Miss Commeline, yourself, and let your sisters and
your brother believe it also. If sorrow in its reaction makes
us think of our friends, let my name come among the list of
yours to you, and with it let the thought come that I am
not the coldest and least sincere. May God bless and
comfort you, I say, with a full heart, knowing what afflictions
like yours are and must be, but confident besides that
'we know not what we do' in weeping for the dearest. In
our sorrow we see the rough side of the stuff; in our joys
the smooth; and who shall say that when the taffeta is
turned the most <i>silk</i> may not be in the sorrows? It is true,
however, that sorrows are heavy, and that sometimes the
conditions of life (which sorrows are) seem hard to us and
overcoming, and I believe that much suffering is necessary
before we come to learn that the world is a good place to
live in and a good place to die in for even the most affectionate
and sensitive.</p>

<p>How glad I should be to hear from you some day, when
it is not burdensome for you to write at length and fully
concerning all of you&mdash;of your sister Maria, and of Laura,
and of your brother, and of all your occupations and plans,
and whether it enters into your dreams, not to say plans,
ever to come to London, or to follow the track of your many
neighbours across the seas, perhaps....</p>

<p>For ourselves we have the happiness of seeing our dear
papa so well, that I am almost justified in fancying happily
that you would not think him altered. He has perpetual
youth like the gods, and I may make affidavit to your brother
nevertheless that we never boiled him up to it. Also his
spirits are good and his 'step on the stair' so light as to
comfort me for not being able to run up and down them
myself. I am essentially better in health, but remain weak
and shattered and at the mercy of a breath of air through a
crevice; and thus the unusually severe winter has left me
somewhat lower than usual without surprising anybody.
Henrietta and Arabel are quite well and at home; George
on circuit, always obliged by your proffered hospitality;
and Charles John and Henry returning from a voyage to
Alexandria in papa's own vessel, the 'Statira.' I set you
an imperfect example of egotism, and hope that you will
double my <i>I's</i> and <i>we's</i>, and kindly trust to
me for being interested in yours....</p>

<p>Yours affectionately,<br />
E.B. BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Saturday, March 3, 1845.<br />

<p>My dearest Friend,&mdash;I am aware that I should have
written to you before, but the cold weather is apt to disable
me and to make me feel idle when it does not do so quite.
Now I am going to write about your remarks on the 'Dublin
Review.'</p>

<p>Certainly I agree with you that there can be no necessity
for explaining anything about the tutorship if you do not
kick against the pricks of the insinuation yourself, and
especially as I consider that you <i>were</i> in a sense my 'tutor,'
inasmuch as I may say, both that nobody ever taught me
so much Greek as you, and also that without you I should
have probably lived and died without any knowledge of the
Greek Fathers. The Greek classics I should have studied
by love and instinct; but the Fathers would probably have
remained in their sepulchres, as far as my reading them was
concerned. Therefore, very gratefully do I turn to you as
my 'tutor' in the best sense, and the more persons call you
so, the better it is for the pleasures of my gratitude. The
review amused me by hitting on the right meaning there,
and besides by its percipiency about your remembering me
during your travels in the East, and sending me home the
Cyprus wine. Some of these reviewers have a wonderful
gift at inferences. The 'Metropolitan Magazine' for March
(which is to be sent to you when papa has read it) contains
a flaming article in my favour, calling me 'the friend of
Wordsworth,' and, moreover, a very little lower than the
angels. You shall see it soon, and it is only just out, of
course, being the March number. The praise is beyond
thanking for, and then I do not know whom to thank&mdash;I
cannot at all guess at the writer.</p>

<p>I have had a kind note from Lord Teynham, whose
oblivion I had ceased to doubt, it seemed so <i>proved</i> to me
that he had forgotten me. But he writes kindly, and it gave
me pleasure to have some sign of recollection, if not of
regard, from one whom I consider with unalterable and
grateful respect, and shall always, although I am aware that
he denies all sympathy to my works and ways in literature
and the world. In fact, and to set my poetry aside, he has
joined that 'strait sect' of the Plymouth Brethren, and, of
course, has straitened his views since we met, and I, by the
reaction of solitude and suffering, have broken many bands
which held me at that time. He was always straiter
than I, and now the difference is immense. For I think
the world wider than I once thought it, and I see God's
love broader than I once saw it. To the 'Touch not, taste
not, handle not' of the strict religionists, I feel inclined to
cry, 'Touch, taste, handle, <i>all things are pure</i>.' But I am
writing this for you and not for him, and you probably
will agree with me, if you think as you used to think, at
least.</p>

<p>But I do not agree with <i>you</i> on the League question, nor
on the woman question connected with it, only we will not
quarrel to-day, and I have written enough already without
an argument at the end.</p>

<p>Can you guess what I have been doing lately? Washing
out my conscience, effacing the blot on my escutcheon,
performing an expiation, translating over again from the
Greek the 'Prometheus' of Aeschylus.</p>

<p>Yes, my very dear friend, I could not bear to let that
frigid, rigid exercise, called a version and called mine, cold
as Caucasus, and flat as the neighbouring plain, stand as
my work. A palinodia, a recantation was necessary to me,
and I have achieved it. Do you blame me or not? Perhaps
I may print it in a magazine, but this is not decided. How
delighted I am to think of your being well. It makes me
very happy.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIBET.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
March 4, 1845.<br />

<p>I reproach myself, dear Mr. W., for my silence, and
began to do so before your kind note reminded me of its
unkindness. I had indeed my pen in my hand three days
ago to write to you, but a cross fate plucked at my sleeve
for the ninety-ninth time, and left me guilty. And you
do not write to reproach me! You only avenge yourself
softly by keeping back all news of your health, and by not
saying a word of the effect on you of the winter which has
done its spiriting so ungently. Which brings me down to
myself. For somebody has been dreaming of me, and
dreams, you know, must go by contraries. And how could
it be otherwise? Although I am on the whole essentially
better&mdash;on the whole!&mdash;yet the peculiar severity of the
winter has acted on me, and the truth is that for the last
month, precisely the last month, I have been feeling (off
and on, as people say) very uncomfortable. Not that I
am essentially worse, but essentially better, on the contrary,
only that the feeling of discomfort and trouble at the heart
(physically) <i>will</i> come with the fall of the thermometer,
and the voice will go!...</p>

<p>And then I have another question to enunciate&mdash;will
the oracle answer?</p>

<p>Do you know <i>who wrote the article in the 'Metropolitan'</i>?
Beseech you, answer me. I have a suspicion, true, that
the critics have been supernaturally kind to me, but the
kindness of this 'Metropolitan' critic so passes the ordinary
limit of kindness, metropolitan or critical, that I cannot but
look among my personal friends for the writer of the article.
Coming to personal friends, I reject one on one ground
and one on another&mdash;for one the graciousness is too
graceful, and for another the grace almost too gracious.
I am puzzled and dizzy with doubt; and&mdash;is it you?
Answer me, will you? If so, I should owe so much
gratitude to you. Suffer me to pay it!&mdash;permit the pleasure
to me of paying it!&mdash;for I know too much of the pleasures
of gratitude to be willing to lose one of them.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
March 6, [1845].<br />

<p>Thank you, dearest Mr. Kenyon&mdash;they are very fine.
The poetry is in <i>them</i>, rather than in Blair. And now I
send them back, and Cunningham and Jerrold, with thanks
on thanks; and if you will be kind enough not to insist on
my reading the letters to Travis<a name="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> within the 'hour,' they
shall wait for the 'Responsibility,' and the two go to you
together.</p>

<p>And as to the tiring, it has not been much, and the
happy day was well worth being tired <i>for</i>. It is better to
be tired with pleasure than with frost; and if I have the
last fatigue too, why it is March, and it is the hour of my
martyrdom always. But I am not ill&mdash;only uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Ah, the 'relenting'! it is rather a bad sign, I am afraid;
notwithstanding the subtilty of your consolations; but I
stroke down my philosophy, to make it shine, like a cat's
back in the dark. The argument from more deserving
poets who prosper less is not very comforting, is it? I
trow not.</p>

<p>But as to the review, be sure&mdash;be very sure that it
is not Mr. Browning's. How you could <i>think</i> even of
Mr. Browning, surprises me. Now, as for me, I know as
well <i>as he does himself</i> that he has had nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p>I should rather suspect Mr. Westwood, the author of
some fugitive poems, who writes to me sometimes; and
the suspicion having occurred to me, I have written to
put the question directly. You shall hear, if I hear in
reply.</p>

<p>May God bless you always. I have heard from dear
Miss Mitford.</p>

<p>Ever affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
March 29, 1845 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;As Arabel has written out for
you the glorification of 'Peter of York,'<a name="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> I shall use an
edge of the same paper to 'fall on your sense' with my
gratitude about the Cyprus wine. Indeed, I could almost
upbraid you for sending me another bottle. It is most
supererogatory kindness in you to think of such a thing.
And I accept it, nevertheless, with thanks instead of
remonstrances, and promise you to drink your health in
and the spring in together, and the east wind out, if you
do not object to it. I have been better for several days,
but my heart is not yet very orderly&mdash;not being able to
recover the veins, I suppose, all in a moment.</p>

<p>For the rest, you always mean what is right and
affectionate, and I am not apt to mistake your meanings
in this respect. Be indulgent to me as far as you can,
when it appears to you that I sink far below your religious
standard, as I am sure I must do oftener than you remind
me. Also, it certainly does appear, to my mind, that we
are not, as Christians, called to the exclusive expression of
Christian doctrine, either in poetry or prose. All truth and
all beauty and all music belong to God&mdash;He is in all
things; and in speaking of all, we speak of Him. In
poetry, which includes all things, 'the diapason closeth
full in God.' I would not lose a note of the lyre, and
whatever He has included in His creation I take to be
holy subject enough for <i>me</i>. That I am blamed for this
view by many, I know, but I cannot see it otherwise, and
when you pay your visit to 'Peter of York' and me, and
are able to talk everything over, we shall agree tolerably
well, I do not doubt.</p>

<p>Ah, what a dream! What a thought! Too good even
to come true!</p>

<p>I did not think that you would much like the 'Duchess
May;' but among the <i>profanum vulgus</i> you cannot think
how successful it has been. There was an account in one
of the fugitive reviews of a lady falling into hysterics on the
perusal of it, although <i>that</i> was nothing to the gush of
tears of which there is a tradition, down the Plutonian
cheeks of a lawyer unknown, over 'Bertha in the Lane.'
But these things should not make anybody vain. It is the
<i>story</i> that has power with people, just what <i>you</i> do not care
for!</p>

<p>About the reviews you ask a difficult question; but I
suppose the best, as reviews, are the 'Dublin Review,'
'Blackwood,' the 'New Quarterly,' and the last 'American,'
I forget the title at this moment, the <i>Whig</i> 'American,' <i>not</i>
the Democratic. The most favorable to me are certainly
the American unremembered, and the late 'Metropolitan,'
which last was written, I hear, by Mr. Charles Grant, a
voluminous writer, but no poet. I consider myself singularly
happy in my reviews, and to have full reason for gratitude
to the profession.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that what the Dublin reviewer did me
the honor of considering an Irishism was the expression
'Do you mind' in 'Cyprus Wine.' But he was wrong,
because it occurs frequently among our elder English
writers, and is as British as London porter.</p>

<p>Now see how you throw me into figurative liquids, by
your last Cyprus. It is the true celestial, this last. But
Arabel pleased me most by bringing back so good an
account of <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate and grateful<br />
ELIBET.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Friday [about January-March 1845].<br />

<p>Dearest Mr. Kenyon,&mdash;If your good nature is still not
at ease, through doubting about how to make Lizzy happy
in a book, you will like to hear perhaps that I have thought
of a certain 'Family Robinson Crusoe,' translated from the
<i>German</i>, I think, <i>not</i> a Robinson <i>purified</i>, mind, but a
Robinson multiplied and compounded.<a name="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> Children like
reading it, I believe. And then there is a 'Masterman
Ready,' or some name like it, by Captain Marryat, also
popular with young readers. Or 'Seaward's Narrative,' by
Miss Porter, would delight her, as it did <i>me</i>, not so many
years ago.</p>

<p>I mention these books, but know nothing of their price;
and only because you asked me, I do mention them. The
fact is that she is not hard to please as to literature, and will
be delighted with anything.</p>

<p>To-day Mr. Poe sent me a volume containing his poems
and tales collected, so now I <i>must</i> write and thank him for
his dedication. What is to be said, I wonder, when a man
calls you the 'noblest of your sex'? 'Sir, you are the most
discerning of yours.' Were you thanked for the garden ticket
yesterday? No, everybody was ungrateful, down to Flush, who
drinks day by day out of his new purple cup, and had it properly
explained how <i>you</i> gave it to him (<i>I</i> explained
<i>that</i>), and yet never came upstairs to express to you his
sense of obligation.</p>

<p>Affectionately yours always,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
Saturday [beginning of April 1845].<br />

<p>My dearest Cousin,&mdash;After all <i>I</i>/ said to <i>you</i>, said the
other day, about Apuleius, and about what couldn't, shouldn't,
and mustn't be done in the matter, I ended by trying the
unlawful art of translating this prose into verse, and, one
after another, have done all the subjects of the Poniatowsky
gems Miss Thompson sent the list of, except <i>two</i>, which I
am doing and shall finish anon.<a name="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> In the meantime it comes
into my head that it is just as well for you to look over my
doings, and judge whether anything in them is to the purpose,
or at all likely to be acceptable. Especially I am
anxious to impress on you that, if I could think for a
moment <i>you would hesitate about rejecting the whole in a
body</i>, from any consideration for <i>me</i>, I should not merely be
vexed but pained. Am I not your own cousin, to be
ordered about as you please? And so take notice that I
will not <i>bear</i> the remotest approach to ceremony in the
matter. What is wrong? what is right? what is too much?
those are the only considerations.</p>

<p>Apuleius is <i>florid</i>, which favored the poetical design on
his sentences. Indeed he is more florid than I have always
liked to make my verses. It is not, of course, an absolute
translation, but as a running commentary on the text it is
sufficiently faithful.</p>

<p>But probably (I say to myself) you do not want so many
illustrations, and all too from one hand?</p>

<p>The two I do not send are 'Psyche contemplating Cupid
asleep,' and 'Psyche and the Eagle.'</p>

<p>And I wait to hear how Polyphemus is to <i>look</i>&mdash;and also
Adonis.</p>

<p>The Magazine goes to you with many thanks. The
sonnet is full of force and expression, and I like it as well
as ever I did&mdash;better even!</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;such happy news to-day! The 'Statira' is at Plymouth,
and my brothers quite well, notwithstanding their
hundred days on the sea! <i>It makes me happy</i>.</p>

<p>Yours most affectionately,<br />
BA.</p>

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;I have been intending every day
to write to tell you that the Cyprus wine is as nectareous as
possible, so fit for the gods, in fact, that I have been forced
to leave it off as unfit for <i>me</i>; it made me so feverish. But
I keep it until the sun shall have made me a little less
mortal; and in the meantime recognise thankfully both
its high qualities and <i>your</i> kind ones. How delightful it is
to have this sense of a summer at hand. <i>Shall</i> I see you
this summer, I wonder. That is a question among my
dreams.</p>

<p>By the last American packet I had two letters, one from
a poet of Massachusetts, and another from a poetess: the
<i>he</i>, Mr. Lowell, and the <i>she</i>, Mrs. Sigourney. She says that
the sound of my poetry is stirring the 'deep green forests of
the New World;' which sounds pleasantly, does it not? And
I understand from Mr. Moxon that a new edition will be
called for before very long, only not immediately....</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
April 3, 1845.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I wrote to you not many days
ago, but I must tell you that our voyagers are safe in
Sandgate break in 'an ugly hulk' (as poor Stormie says despondingly),
suffering three or four days of quarantine agony,
and that we expect to see them on Monday or Tuesday in
the full bloom of their ill humour. I am happy to think,
according to the present symptoms, that the mania for sea
voyages is considerably abated. 'Nothing could be more
miserable,' exclaims Storm; 'the only comfort of the whole
four months is the safety of the beans, tell papa'&mdash;and the
safety of the beans is rather a Pythagoraean<a name="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> equivalent for
four months' vexation, though not a bean of them all
should have lost in freshness and value! He could
scarcely write, he said, for the chilblains on his hands, and
was in utter destitution of shirts and sheets. Oh! I have
very good hopes that for the future Wimpole Street may be
found endurable.</p>

<p>Well, and you are at once angry and satisfied, I suppose,
about Maynooth; just as I am! satisfied with the justice
as far as it goes, and angry and disgusted at the hideous
shrieks of intolerance and bigotry which run through the
country. The dissenters have very nearly disgusted me,
what with the Education clamour, and the Presbyterian
chapel cry, and now this Maynooth cry; and certainly it is
wonderful how people can see rights as rights in their own
hands, and as wrongs in the hands of their opposite neighbours.
Moreover it seems to me atrocious that we who insist
on seven millions of Catholics supporting a church they call
heretical, should <i>dare</i> to talk of our scruples (conscientious
scruples forsooth!) about assisting with a poor pittance of
very insufficient charity their 'damnable idolatry.' Why,
every cry of complaint we utter is an argument against the
wrong we have been committing for years and years, and
must be so interpreted by every honest and disinterested
thinker in the world. Of course I should prefer the Irish
establishment coming down, to any endowment at all; I
should prefer a trial of the voluntary system throughout
Ireland; but as it is adjudged on all hands impossible to
attempt this in the actual state of parties and countries, why
this Maynooth grant and subsequent endowment of the
Catholic Church in Ireland seem the simple alternative,
obviously and on the first principles of justice. Macaulay
was very great, was he not? He appeared to me <i>conclusive</i>
in logic and sentiment. The sensation everywhere is extraordinary,
I am sorry really to say!</p>

<p>Wordsworth is in London, having been commanded
up to the Queen's ball. He went in Rogers's court dress,
or did I tell you so the other day? And I hear that the
fair Majesty of England was quite 'fluttered' at seeing him.
'She had not a word to say,' said Mrs. Jameson, who came
to see me the other day and complained of the omission as
'unqueenly;' but I disagreed with her and thought the being
'<i>fluttered</i>' far the highest compliment. But she told me that
a short time ago the Queen confessed she never had read
Wordsworth, on which a maid of honour observed, 'That is
a pity, he would do your Majesty a great deal of good.' Mrs.
Jameson declared that Miss Murray, a maid of honour, very
deeply attached to the Queen, assured her (Mrs. J.) of the
answer being quite as abrupt as <i>that</i>; as direct, and to the
purpose; and no offence intended or received. I like Mrs.
Jameson better the more I see her, and with grateful reason,
she is so kind. Now do write directly, and let me hear of
you [in d]etail. And tell Mr. Martin to make a point of
coming home to us, with no grievances but political ones.
The Bazaar is to be something sublime in its degree, and I
shall have a sackcloth feeling all next week. All the rail
carriages will be wound up to radiate into it, I hear, and
the whole country is to be shot into the heart of London.</p>

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
Wimpole Street: April 9, 1845.<br />

<p>Poor Hood! Ah! I had feared that the scene was
closing on him. And I am glad that a little of the poor
gratitude of the world is laid down at his door just now to
muffle to his dying ear the harsher sounds of life. I
forgive much to Sir Robert for the sake of that letter&mdash;though,
after all, the minister is not high-hearted, or made
of heroic stuff.<a name="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p>I am delighted that you should appreciate Mr. Browning's
high power&mdash;very high, according to my view&mdash;very high,
and various. Yes, 'Paracelsus' you <i>should</i> have. 'Sordello'
has many fine things in it, but, having been thrown down
by many hands as unintelligible, and retained in mine as
certainly of the Sphinxine literature, with all its power, I
hesitate to be imperious to you in my recommendations
of it. Still, the book <i>is</i> worth being <i>studied</i>&mdash;study is
necessary to it, as, indeed, though in a less degree, to all
the works of this poet; study is peculiarly necessary to it.
He is a true poet, and a poet, I believe, of a large '<i>future
in-rus, about to be</i>.' He is only growing to the height he will
attain.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
April 1845.<br />

<p>The sin of Sphinxine literature I admit. Have I not
struggled hard to renounce it? Do I not, day by day? Do
you know that I have been told that <i>I</i> have written things
harder to interpret than Browning himself?&mdash;only I cannot,
cannot believe it&mdash;he is so very hard. Tell me honestly
(and although I attributed the excessive good nature of the
'Metropolitan' criticism to you, I <i>know</i> that you can speak
the truth <i>truly</i>!) if anything like the Sphinxineness of
Browning, you discover in me; take me as far back as 'The
Seraphim' volume and answer! As for Browning, the fault
is certainly great, and the disadvantage scarcely calculable,
it is so great. He cuts his language into bits, and one has
to join them together, as young children do their dissected
maps, in order to make any meaning at all, and to study
hard before one can do it. Not that I grudge the study
or the time. The depth and power of the significance
(when it is apprehended) glorifies the puzzle. With you
and me it is so; but with the majority of readers, even of
readers of poetry, it is not and cannot be so.</p>

<p>The consequence is, that he is not read except in a
peculiar circle very strait and narrow. He will not die,
because the principle of life is in him, but he will not live
the warm summer life which is permitted to many of very
inferior faculty, because he does not come out into the sun.</p>

<p>The following letter relates to the controversy raging
round Miss Martineau and her mesmerism. Miss Barrett
had evidently referred to it in a letter to Mr. Chorley, which
has not been preserved.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: April 28, 1845.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Chorley,&mdash;I felt quite sure that you would
take my postscript for a womanish thing, and a little doubtful
whether you would not take the whole allusion (in or out of
a postscript) for an impertinent thing; but the impulse to
speak was stronger than the fear of speaking; and from the
peculiarities of my position, I have come to write by impulses
just as other people talk by them. Still, if I had
known that the subject was so painful to you, I certainly
would not have touched on it, strong as my feeling has
been about it, and full and undeniable as is my sympathy
with our noble-minded friend, both as a woman and a
thinker. Not that I consider (of course I cannot) that she
has made out anything like a '<i>fact</i>' in the Tynemouth
story&mdash;not that I think the evidence offered in any sort sufficient;
take it as it was in the beginning and unimpugned&mdash;not
that I have been otherwise than of opinion throughout
that she was precipitate and indiscreet, however generously
so, in her mode and time of advocating the mesmeric question;
but that she is at liberty as a thinking being (in my
mind) to hold an opinion, the grounds of which she cannot
yet justify to the world. Do you not think she may be?
Have you not opinions yourself beyond what you can prove
to others? Have we not all? And because some of the
links of the outer chain of a logical argument fail, or seem
to fail, are we therefore to have our 'honours' questioned,
because we do not yield what is suspended to an inner
uninjured chain of at once subtler and stronger formation?
For what I venture to object to in the argument of the
'Athenaeum' is the making a <i>moral obligation</i> of an <i>intellectual
act</i>, which is the first step and gesture (is it not?) in all
persecution for opinion; and the involving of the 'honour'
of an opponent in the motion of recantation she is invited
to. This I do venture to exclaim against. I do cry aloud
against this; and I do say this, that when we call it
'hard,' we are speaking of it softly. Why, consider how it
is! The 'Athenaeum' has done quite enough to <i>disprove
the proving</i> of the wreck story,<a name="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> and no more at all. The
disproving of the proof of the wreck story is indeed enough
to disprove the wreck story and to disprove mesmerism
itself (as far as the proof of mesmerism depends on the
proof of the wreck story, and no farther) with all doubters
and undetermined inquirers; but with the very large class
of previous <i>believers</i>, this disproof of a proof is a mere accident,
and cannot be expected to have much logical consequence.
Believing that such things may be as this revelation
of a wreck, they naturally are less exacting of the stabilities
of the proving process. What we think probable we do
not call severely for the proof of. Moreover Miss Martineau
is not only a believer in the mysteries of mesmerism (and
she wrote to me the other day that in Birmingham, where
she is, she has present cognisance of <i>three cases of clairvoyance</i>),
but she is a believer in the personal integrity of
her witnesses. She has what she has well called an 'incommunicable
confidence.' And this, however incommunicable,
is sufficiently comprehensible to all persons who
know what personal faith is, to place her 'honour,' I do
maintain, high above any suspicion, any charge with the
breath of man's lips. I am sure you agree with me, dear
Mr. Chorley&mdash;ah! it will be a comfort and joy together.
Dear Miss Mitford and I often quarrel softly about literary
life and its toils and sorrows, she against and I in favour of;
but we never could differ about the worth and comfort of
domestic affection.</p>

<p>Ever sincerely yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear of the novel. And the comedy?</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: April 28, 1845.<br />

<p>Dear Mr. Chorley,&mdash;... For Miss Martineau, is it not
true that she <i>has</i> admitted her wreck story to have no proof?
Surely she has. Surely she said that the evidence was
incapable, at this point of time, of justification to the
<i>exoteric</i>, and that the question had sunk now to one of
character, to which her opponent answered that it had always
<i>been</i> one of character. And you must admit that the
direct and unmitigated manner of depreciating the reputation,
not merely of Jane Arrowsmith, but of Mrs. Wynyard,
a personal friend of Miss Martineau's to whom she professes
great obligations, could not be otherwise than exasperating
to a woman of her generous temper, and this just in the
crisis of her gratitude for her restoration to life and enjoyment
by the means (as she considers it) of this friend. Not
that I feel at all convinced of her having been cured by
mesmerism; I have told her openly that I doubt it a little,
and she is not angry with me for saying so. Also, the
wreck story, and (as you suggest) the three new cases of clairvoyance;
why, one <i>cannot</i>, you know, give one's specific
convictions to general sweeping testimonies, with a mist all
round them. Still, I do lean to believing this <i>class</i> of
mysteries, and I see nothing more incredible in the
apocalypse of the wreck and other marvels of clairvoyance,
than in that singular adaptation of another person's senses,
which is a common phenomenon of the simple forms of
mesmerism. If it is credible that a person in a mesmeric
sleep can taste the sourness of the vinegar on another
person's palate, I am ready to go the whole length of the
transmigration of senses. But after all, except from hearing
so much, I am as ignorant as you are, in my own experience.
One of my sisters was thrown into a sort of swoon, and
could not open her eyelids, though she heard what passed,
once or twice or thrice; and she might have been a
prophetess by this time, perhaps, if, partly from her own
feeling on the subject, and partly from mine, she had not
determined never to try the experiment again. It is hideous
and detestable to my imagination; as I confessed to you, it
makes my blood run backwards; and if I were <i>you</i>, I would
not (with the nervous weakness you speak of) throw myself
into the way of it, I really would not. Think of a female
friend of mine begging me to give her a lock of my hair, or
rather begging my sister to 'get it for her,' that she might
send it to a celebrated prophet of mesmerism in Paris, to
have an oracle concerning me. Did you ever, since the
days of the witches, hear a more ghastly proposition? It
shook me so with horror, I had scarcely voice to say 'no,'
hough I <i>did</i> say it very emphatically at last, I assure you.
A lock of my hair for a Parisian prophet? Why, if I
had yielded, I should have felt the steps of pale spirits
treading as thick as snow all over my sofa and bed, by day
and night, and pulling a corresponding lock of hair on my
head at awful intervals. <i>I</i>, who was born with a double set
of nerves, which are always out of order; the most excitable
person in the world, and nearly the most superstitious. I
should have been scarcely sane at the end of a fortnight, I
believe of myself! Do you remember the little spirit in gold
shoe-buckles, who was a familiar of Heinrich Stilling's?
Well, I should have had a French one to match the German,
with Balzac's superfine boot-polish in place of the buckles,
as surely as I lie here a mortal woman.</p>

<p>I congratulate you (amid all cares and anxieties) upon
the view of Naples in the distance, but chiefly on your own
happy and just estimate of your selected position in life.
It does appear to me wonderfully and mournfully wrong,
when men of letters, as it is too much the fashion for them
to do, take to dishonoring their profession by fruitless
bewailings and gnashings of teeth; when, all the time, it
must be their own fault if it is not the noblest in the world.
Miss Mitford treats me as a blind witness in this case;
because I have seen nothing of the literary world, or any
other sort of world, and yet cry against her 'pen and ink'
cry. It is the cry I least like to hear from her lips, of all
others; and it is unworthy of them altogether. On the lips
of a woman of letters, it sounds like jealousy (which it cannot
be with <i>her</i>), as on the lips of a woman of the world, like
ingratitude. Madame Girardin's 'Ecole des Journalistes'
deserved Jules Janin's reproof of it; and there is something
noble and touching in that feeling of brotherhood among
men of letters, which he invokes. I am so glad to hear you
say that I am right, glad for your sake and glad for mine.
In fact, there is something which is attractive to <i>me</i>, and
which has been attractive ever since I was as high as this
table, even in the old worn type of Grub Street authors and
garret poets. Men and women of letters are the first in the
whole world to me, and I would rather be the least among
them, than 'dwell in the courts of princes.'</p>

<p>Forgive me for writing so fast and far. Just as if you
had nothing to do but to read me. Oh, for patience for the
novel.</p>

<p>I am, faithfully yours,<br />
ELIZABETH B. BARRETT.</p>

<i>To Miss Thomson</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Friday, May 16, 1845 [postmark].<br />

<p>I write one line to thank you, dear Miss Thomson, for
<i>your</i> translation (so far too liberal, though true to the spirit
of my intention) of my work for your album. How could
it <i>not</i> be a pleasure to me to work for you?</p>

<p>As to my using those manuscripts otherwise than in
your service, I do not at all think of it, and I wish to say
this. Perhaps I do not (also) partake quite your 'divine
fury' for converting our sex into Greek scholarship, and I
do not, I confess, think it as desirable as you do. Where
there is a love for poetry, and thirst for beauty strong enough
to justify labour, let these impulses, which are noble, be
obeyed; but in the case of the multitude it is different;
and the mere <i>fashion of scholarship</i> among women would
be a disagreeable vain thing, and worse than vain. You,
who are a Greek yourself, know that the Greek language is
not to be learnt in a flash of lightning and by Hamiltonian
systems, but that it swallows up year after year of studious life.
Now I have a 'doxy' (as Warburton called it), that there is
no exercise of the mind so little profitable to the mind as
the study of languages. It is the nearest thing to a passive
recipiency&mdash;is it not?&mdash;as a mental action, though it leaves
one as weary as ennui itself. Women want to be made to
<i>think actively</i>: their apprehension is quicker than that of
men, but their defect lies for the most part in the logical
faculty and in the higher mental activities. Well, and then,
to remember how our own English poets are neglected and
scorned; our poets of the Elizabethan age! I would
rather that my countrywomen began by loving <i>these</i>.</p>

<p>Not that I would blaspheme against Greek poetry, or
depreciate the knowledge of the language as an attainment.
I congratulate <i>you</i> on it, though I never should think of
trying to convert other women into a desire for it. Forgive
me.</p>

<p>To think of Mr. Burges's comparing my Nonnus to the
right Nonnus makes my hair stand on end, and the truth is
I had flattered myself that nobody would take such trouble.
I have not much reverence for Nonnus, and have pulled
him and pushed him and made him stand as I chose, never
fearing that my naughty impertinences would be brought to
light. For the rest, I thank you gratefully (and may I
respectfully and gratefully thank Miss Bayley?) for the kind
words of both of you, both in this letter and as my sister
heard them. It is delightful to me to find such grace in the
eyes of dearest Mr. Kenyon's friends, and I remain, dear
Miss Thomson,</p>

<p>Truly yours, and gladly,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>If there should be anything more at any time for me to
do, I trust to your trustfulness.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Thomson</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: Monday [1845].<br />

<p>My dear Miss Thomson,&mdash;Believe of me that it can
only give me pleasure when you are affectionate enough to
treat me as a friend; and for the rest, nobody need apologise
for taking another into the vineyards&mdash;least Miss Bayley
and yourself to <i>me</i>. At the first thought I felt sure that
there must be a great deal about vines in these Greeks of
ours, and am surprised, I confess, in turning from one to
another, to find how few passages of length are quotable,
and how the images drop down into a line or two. Do you
know the passage in the seventh 'Odyssey' where there is a
vineyard in different stages of ripeness?&mdash;of which Pope has
made the most, so I tore up what I began to write, and
leave you to him. It is in Alcinous' gardens, and between
the first and second hundred lines of the book. The one
from the 'Iliad,' open to Miss Bayley's objection, is yet too
beautiful and appropriate, I fancy, for you to throw over.
Curious it is that my first recollection went from that
shield of Achilles to Hesiod's 'Shield of Hercules,' from
which I send you a version&mdash;leaving out of it what dear Miss
Bayley would object to on a like ground with the other:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Some gathered grapes, with reap-hooks in their hands,<br />
While others bore off from the gathering hands<br />
Whole baskets-full of bunches, black and white,<br />
From those great ridges heaped up into fight,<br />
With vine-leaves and their curling tendrils. So<br />
They bore the baskets ...<br />
<br />
... Yes! and all were saying<br />
Their jests, while each went staggering in a row<br />
Beneath his grape-load to the piper's playing.<br />
The grapes were purple-ripe. And here, in fine,<br />
Men trod them out, and there they drained the wine.<br />
</div>

<p>In the 'Works and Days' Hesiod says again, what is not
worth your listening to, perhaps:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
And when that Sinus and Orion come<br />
To middle heaven, and when Aurora&mdash;she<br />
O' the rosy fingers&mdash;looks inquiringly<br />
Full on Arcturus, straightway gather home<br />
The general vintage. And, I charge you, see<br />
All, in the sun and open air, outlaid<br />
Ten days and nights, and five days in the shade.<br />
The sixth day, pour in vases the fine juice&mdash;<br />
The gift of Bacchus, who gives joys for use.<br />
</div>

<p>Anacreon talks to the point so well that you must
forgive him, I think, for being Anacreontic, and take from
his hands what is not defiled. The translation you send
me does not 'smell of Anacreon,' nor please me. Where
did you get it? Would this be at all fresher?</p>

<div class="blkquot">
Grapes that wear a purple skin,<br />
Men and maidens carry in,<br />
Brimming baskets on their shoulders,<br />
Which they topple one by one<br />
Down the winepress. Men are holders<br />
Of the place there, and alone<br />
Tread the grapes out, crush them down,<br />
Letting loose the soul of wine&mdash;<br />
Praising Bacchus as divine,<br />
With the loud songs called his own!<br />
</div>

<p>You are aware of the dresser of the vine in Homer's
'Hymn to Mercury' translated so exquisitely by Shelley, and
of a very beautiful single figure in Theocritus besides.
Neither probably would suit your purpose. In the 'Pax'
of Aristophanes there is an idle 'Chorus' who talks of
looking at the vines and watching the grapes ripen, and
eating them at last, but there is nothing of vineyard work
in it, so I dismiss the whole.</p>

<p>For 'Hector and Andromache,' would you like me to
try to do it for you? It would amuse me, and you should
not be bound to do more with what I send you than to
throw it into the fire if it did not meet your wishes precisely.
The same observation applies, remember, to this
little sheet, which I have <i>kept</i>&mdash;delayed sending&mdash;just
because I wanted to let you have a trial of my strength
on 'Andromache' in the same envelope; but the truth
is that it is not <i>begun</i> yet, partly through other occupation,
and partly through the lassitude which the cold wind
of the last few days always brings down on me. Yesterday
I made an effort, and felt like a broken stick&mdash;not even
a bent one! So wait for a warm day (and what a season
we have had! I have been walking up and down stairs
and pretending to be quite well), and I will promise to
do my best, and certainly an inferior hand may get nearer
to touch the great Greek lion's mane than Pope's did.</p>

<p>Will you give my love to dear Miss Bayley? She shall
hear from me&mdash;and <i>you</i> shall, in a day or two. And do
not mind Mr. Kenyon. He 'roars as softly as a sucking dove;'
nevertheless he is an intolerant monster, as I half
told him the other day.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Miss Thomson,<br />
Affectionately yours,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: May 22, 1845.<br />

<p>Did you persevere with 'Sordello'? I hope so. Be
sure that we may all learn (as poets) much and deeply
from it, for the writer speaks true oracles. When you
have read it through, then read for relaxation and recompense
the last 'Bell and Pomegranate' by the same poet,
his 'Colombo's Birthday,' which is exquisite. Only 'Pippa
Passes' I lean to, or kneel to, with the deepest reverence.
Wordsworth has been in town, and is gone. Tennyson is
still here. He likes London, I hear, and hates Cheltenham,
where he resides with his family, and he smokes pipe
after pipe, and does not mean to write any more poems.
Are we to sing a requiem?</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Saturday, July 21, 1845 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;You are kind to exceeding
kindness, and I am as grateful as any of your long-ago kind
invitations ever found me. It is something pleasant, indeed,
and like a return to life, to be asked by you to spend two
or three days in your house, and I thank you for this
pleasantness, and for the goodness, on your own part,
which induced it. You may be perfectly sure that no
Claypon, though he should live in Arcadia, would be preferred
by me to <i>you</i> as a host, and I wonder how you could
entertain the imagination of such a thing. Mr. Kenyon,
indeed, has asked me repeatedly to spend a few hours on a
sofa in his house, and, the Regent's Park being so much
nearer than you are, I had promised to think of it. But I
have not yet found it possible to accomplish even that
quarter of a mile's preferment, and my ambition is forced
to be patient when I begin to think of St. John's Wood.
I am considerably stronger, and increasing in strength, and
in time, with a further advance of the summer, I may
do 'such things&mdash;what they are yet, I know not.' Yes, I
<i>know</i> that they relate to <i>you</i>, and that I have a hope, as
well as an earnest, affectionate desire, to sit face to face
with you once more before this summer closes. Do, in the
meantime, believe that I am very grateful to you for your
kind, considerate proposal, and that it is not made in vain
for my wishes, and that I am not likely willingly 'to spend
two or three days' with anybody in the world before I do
so with yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter has not paid us his usual Saturday's visit,
and therefore I have no means of answering the questions
you put in relation to him. We will ask him about 'times
and seasons' when next we see him, and you shall hear.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear much of Robert Montgomery,
commonly called Satan Montgomery because the author of
'Satan,' of the 'Omnipresence of the Deity,' and of various
poems which pass through edition after edition, nobody
knows how or <i>why</i>? I understand that his pew (he is a
clergyman) is sown over with red rosebuds from ladies of
the congregation, and that the same fair hands have made
and presented to him, in the course of a single season, one
hundred pairs of slippers. Whereupon somebody said to
this Reverend Satan, 'I never knew before, Mr. Montgomery,
that you were a <i>centipede</i>'</p>

<p>Through the summer of 1845, Miss Barrett, as usual,
recovered strength, but so slightly that her doctor urged that
she should not face the winter in England. Plans were
accordingly made for her going abroad, to which the
following letters refer, but the scheme ultimately broke
down before the prohibition of Mr. Barrett&mdash;a prohibition
for which no valid reason was put forward, and which, to
say the least, bore the colour of unaccountable indifference
to his daughter's health and wishes. The matter is of
some importance on account of its bearing on the action
taken by Miss Barrett in the autumn of the following
year.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Monday, July 29, 1845 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;I am ashamed not to have
written before, and yet have courage enough to ask you to
write to me as soon as you can. Day by day I have had
good intentions enough (the fact is) about writing, to seem
to deserve some good deeds from you, which is contrary to
all wisdom and reason, I know, but is rather natural, after
all. What <i>my</i> deeds have been, you will be apt to ask.
Why, all manner of idleness, which is the most interrupting,
you know, of all things. The Hedleys have been flitting
backwards and forwards, staying, some of them, for a month
at a time in London, and then going, and then coming
again; and I have had other visitors, few but engrossing
'after their kind.' And I have been <i>getting well</i>&mdash;which is
a process&mdash;going out into the carriage two or three times a
week, abdicating my sofa for my armchair, moving from one
room to another now and then, and walking about mine
quite as well as, and with considerably more complacency
than, a child of two years old. Altogether, I do think that
if you were kind enough to be glad to see me looking better
when you were in London, you would be kind enough to be
still gladder if you saw me now. Everybody praises me,
and I look in the looking-glass with a better conscience.
Also, it is an improving improvement, and will be, until,
you know, the last hem of the garment of summer is lost
sight of, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;I must either follow to another
climate, or be ill again&mdash;<i>that</i> I know, and am prepared for.
It is but dreary work, this undoing of my Penelope web in
the winter, after the doing of it through the summer, and
the more progress one makes in one's web, the more dreary
the prospect of the undoing of all these fine silken stitches.
But we shall see....</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Tuesday [October 1845].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Do believe that I have not
been, as I have seemed, perhaps, forgetful of you through
this silence. This last proof of your interest and affection
for me&mdash;in your letter to Henrietta&mdash;quite rouses me to
<i>speak out</i> my remembrance of you, and I have been
remembering you all the time that I did not speak, only I
was so perplexed and tossed up and down by doubts and
sadnesses as to require some shock from without to force
the speech from me. Your verses, in their grace of kindness,
and the ivy from Wordsworth's cottage, just made me think
to myself that I would write to you before I left England,
but when you talk really of coming to see me, why, I must
speak! You overcome me with the sense of your goodness
to me.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, I will not have you come! The farewells
are bad enough which come to us, without our going to
seek them, and I would rather wait and meet you on the
Continent, or in England again, than see you now, just to
part from you. And you cannot guess how shaken I am,
and how I cling to every plank of a little calm. Perhaps I
am going on the 17th or 20th. Certainly I have made up my
mind to do it, and shall do it as a bare matter of duty; and
it is one of the most painful acts of duty which my whole
life has set before me. The road is as rough as possible,
as far as I can see it. At the same time, being absolutely
convinced from my own experience and perceptions, and
the unhesitating advice of two able medical men (Dr.
Chambers, one of them), that to escape the English winter
will be <i>everything for me</i>, and that it involves the comfort
and usefulness of the rest of my life, I have resolved to do
it, let the circumstances of the doing be as painful as they
may. If you were to see me you would be astonished to
see the work of the past summer; but all these improvements
will ebb away with the sun&mdash;while I am assured of
permanent good if I leave England. The struggle with me
has been a very painful one; I cannot enter on the how and
wherefore at this moment. I had expected more help than
I have found, and am left to myself, and thrown so on my
own sense of duty as to feel it right, for the sake of future years,
to make an effort to stand by myself as I best can. At the
same time, I will not tell you that at the last hour something
may not happen to keep me at home. <i>That</i> is neither impossible
nor improbable. If, for instance, I find that I cannot
have one of my brothers with me, why, the going in that case
would be out of the question. Under ordinary circumstances
I shall go, and if the experiment of going fails, why,
then I shall have had the satisfaction of having tried it, and
of knowing that it is God's will which keeps me a prisoner,
and makes me a burden. As it is, I have been told that
if I had gone years ago I <i>should be well now</i>; that one lung
is very slightly affected, but the nervous system <i>absolutely
shattered</i>, as the state of the pulse proves. I am in the habit
of taking forty drops of laudanum a day, and <i>cannot do with
less</i>, that is, the medical man <i>told me</i> that I could not do
with less, saying so with his hand on the pulse. The cold
weather, they say, acts on the lungs, and produces the
weakness indirectly, whereas the necessary shutting up acts
on the <i>nerves</i> and prevents them from having a chance
of recovering their tone. And thus, without any mortal
disease, or any disease of equivalent seriousness, I am
thrown out of life, out of the ordinary sphere of its enjoyment
and activity, and made a burden to myself and to
others. Whereas there is a means of escape from these
evils, and God has opened the door of escape, as wide
as I see it!</p>

<p>In all ways, for my own <i>happiness's sake</i> I do need <i>a
proof</i> that the evil is irremediable. And this proof (or the
counter-proof) I am about to seek in Italy.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambers has advised <i>Pisa</i>, and I go in the direct
steamer from the Thames to Leghorn. I have good courage,
and as far as my own strength goes, sufficient means.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin, more than I thought at first of
telling you, I have told you. Much beside there is, painful
to talk of, but I hope I have determined to do what is right,
and that the determination has not been formed ungently,
unscrupulously, nor unaffectionately in respect to the
feelings of others. I would die for some of those, but there,
has been affection opposed to affection.</p>

<p>This in confidence, of course. May God bless both of
you! Pray for me, dearest Mrs. Martin. Make up your
mind to go somewhere soon&mdash;shall you not?&mdash;before the
winter shuts the last window from which you see the sun.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambers said that he would 'answer for it' that
the voyage would rather do me good than harm. Let me
suffer sea sickness or not, he said, he would answer for its
doing me no harm.</p>

<p>I hope to take Arabel with me, and either Storm or
Henry. This is my hope.</p>

<p>Gratefully and affectionately I think of all your kindness
and interest. May dear Mr. Martin lose nothing in this
coming winter! I shall think of you, and not cease to love
you. Moreover, you shall hear again from</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
October 27, 1845 [postmark].<br />

<p>My very dear Friend,&mdash;It is so long since I wrote that I
must write, I must ruffle your thoughts with a little breath
from my side. Listen to me, my dear friend. That I have
not written has scarcely been my fault, but my misfortune
rather, for I have been quite unstrung and overcome by
agitation and anxiety, and thought that I should be able to
tell you at last of being calmer and happier, but it was all
in vain. I do not leave England, my dear friend. It is
decided that I remain on in my prison. It was my full
intention to go. I considered it to be a clear duty, and I
made up my mind to perform it, let the circumstances be
ever so painfully like obstacles; but when the moment
came it appeared impossible for me to set out alone, and
also impossible to take my brother and sister with me
without involving them in difficulties and displeasure. Now
what I could risk for myself I could not risk for others, and
the very kindness with which they desired me not to think
of them only made me think of them more, as was natural
and just. So Italy is given up, and I fall back into the hands
of God, who is merciful, trusting Him with the time that
shall be.</p>

<p>Arabel would have gone to tell you all this a fortnight
since, but one of my brothers has been ill with fever which
was not exactly typhus, but of the typhoid character, and
we knew that you would rather not see her under the circumstances.
He is very much better (it is Octavius), and has
been out of bed to-day and yesterday.</p>

<p>Do not reproach me either for not writing or for not
going, my very dear friend. I have been too heavy-hearted
for words; and as to the deeds, you would not have wished
me to lead others into difficulties, the extent and result of
which no one could calculate. It would not have been just
of me.</p>

<p>And <i>you</i>, how are you, and what are you doing?</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear dear friend!</p>

<p>Ever yours I am, affectionately and gratefully,<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Chorley</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: November 1845.<br />

<p>I must trouble you with another letter of thanks, dear
Mr. Chorley, now that I have to thank you for the value of
the work as well as the kindness of the gift, for I have read
your three volumes of 'Pomfret'<a name="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> with interest and moral
assent, and with great pleasure in various ways: it is a pure,
true book without effort, which, in these days of gesture
and rolling of the eyes, is an uncommon thing. Also you
make your 'private judgment' work itself out quietly as a
simple part of the love of truth, instead of being the loud
heroic virtue it is so apt in real life to profess itself, seldom
moving without drums and trumpets and the flying of
party colours. All these you have put down rightly, wisely,
and boldly, and it was, in my mind, no less wise than bold
of you to let in that odour of Tyrrwhitism into the folds of
the purple, and so prevent the very possibility of any
'prestige.' If I complained it might be that your 'private
judgment' confines its reference to 'public opinion,' and
shuns, too proudly perhaps, the higher and deeper relations
of human responsibility. But there are difficulties, I see,
and you choose your path advisedly, of course. The
best character in the book I take to be <i>Rose</i>; I cannot
hesitate in selecting him. He is so lifelike with the world's
conventional life that you hear his footsteps when he walks,
and, indeed, I think his boots were apt to creak just the
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of a creak, just as a gentleman's boots might,
and he is excellently consistent, even down to the choice of
a wife whom he could patronise. I hope you like your own
Mr. Rose, and that you will forgive me for jilting Grace for
Helena, which I could not help any more than Walter
could. But now, may I venture to ask a question? Would
it not have been wise of you if, on the point of <i>reserve</i>, you
had thrown a deeper shade of opposition into the characters
or rather manners of these women? Helena sits like a
statue (and could Grace have done more?) when she wins
Walter's heart in Italy. Afterwards, and by fits at the time,
indeed, the artist fire bursts from her, but there was a great
deal of smouldering when there should have been a clear
heat to justify Walter's change of feeling. And then, in
respect to <i>that</i>, do you really think that your Grace was
generous, heroic (with the evidence she had of the change)
in giving up her engagement? For her own sake, could
she have done otherwise? I fancy not; the position
seems surrounded by its own necessities, and no room for
a doubt. I write on my own doubts, you see, and you will
smile at them, or understand all through them that if the
book had not interested me like a piece of real life, I should
not find myself <i>backbiting</i> as if all these were 'my neighbours.'
The pure tender feeling of the closing scenes
touched me to better purpose, believe me, and I applaud
from my heart and conscience your rejection of that low
creed of 'poetical justice' which is neither justice nor poetry
which is as degrading to virtue as false to experience, and
which, thrown from your book, raises it into a pure atmosphere
at once.</p>

<p>I could go on talking, but remind myself (I do hope in
time) that I might show my gratitude better. With sincere
wishes for the success of the work (for just see how practically
we come to trust to poetical justices after all our
theories&mdash;<i>I</i>, I mean, and <i>mine</i>!), and with respect and
esteem for the writer,</p>

<p>I remain very truly yours,<br />
ELIZABETH BARRETT BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
50 Wimpole Street: December 1, 1845.<br />

<p>My dear Mrs. Jameson,&mdash;I receive your letter, as I
must do every sign of your being near and inclined to think
of me in kindness, gladly, and assure you at once that whenever
you can spend a half-hour on me you will find me
enough myself to have a true pleasure in welcoming you,
say any day except next Saturday or the Monday immediately
following.</p>

<p>As soon as I heard of your return to England I ventured
to hope that some good might come of it to me in my room
here, besides the general good, which I look for with the
rest of the public, when the censer swings back into the
midst of us again. And how good of you, dear Mrs.
Jameson, to think of me there where the perfumes were set
burning; it makes me glad and grand that you should have
been able to do so. Also the kind wishes which came with
the thoughts (you say) were not in vain, for I have been
very idle and very <i>well</i>; the angel of the summer has done
more for me even than usual, and till the last wave of his
wing I took myself to be quite well and at liberty, and even
now I am as well as anyone can be who has heard the
prison door shut for a whole winter at least, and knows it to
be the only English alternative of a grave. Which is a
gloomy way of saying that I am well but forced to shut
myself up with disagreeable precautions all round, and I
ought to be gratified instead of gloomy. Believe me that
I <i>shall</i> be so when you come to see me, remaining in the
meanwhile</p>

<p>Most truly yours,<br />
ELIZABETH BARRETT.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Friday [about December 1845].<br />

<p>I am the guilty person, dearest Mrs. Martin! You
would have heard from Henrietta at least yesterday, only
I persisted in promising to write instead of her; and so, if
there are reproaches, let them fall. Not that I am audacious
and without shame! But I have grown familiar with an
evil conscience as to these matters of not writing when I
ought; and long ago I grew familiar with your mercy and
power of pardoning; and then&mdash;and then&mdash;if silence and
sulkiness are proved crimes of mine to ever such an extreme,
why it would not be unnatural. Do you think I was born to
live the life of an oyster, such as I <i>do</i> live here? And so,
the moaning and gnashing of teeth are best done alone
and without taking anyone into confidence. And so, this is
all I have to say for myself, which perhaps you will be glad
of; for you will be ready to agree with me that next to such
faults of idleness, negligence, silence (call them by what
names you please!) as I have been guilty of, is the repentance
of them, if indeed the latter be not the most unpardonable
of the two.</p>

<p>And what are you doing so late in Herefordshire? Is
dear Mr. Martin too well, and tempting the demons? I do
hope that the next news of you will be of your being about
to approach the sun and visit us on the road. You do not
give your wisdom away to your friends, all of it, I hope and
trust&mdash;not even to Reynolds.</p>

<p>Tell Mr. Martin that a new great daily newspaper, professing
'<i>ultraism</i>' at the right end (meaning his and mine),
is making 'mighty preparation,' to be called the 'Daily
News,'<a name="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> to be edited by Dickens and to combine with the
most liberal politics such literature as gives character to the
French journals&mdash;the objects being both to help the people
and to give a <i>status</i> to men of letters, socially and
politically&mdash;great objects which will not be attained, I fear,
by any such means. In the first place, I have misgivings as to
Dickens. He has not, I think, <i>breadth</i> of mind enough for
such work, with all his gifts; but we shall see. An immense
capital has been offered and actually advanced. Be good
patriots and order the paper. And talking of papers, I
hope you read in the 'Morning Chronicle' Landor's verses
to my friend and England's poet, Mr. Browning.<a name="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> They
have much beauty.</p>

<p>You know that Occy has been ill, and that he is well?
I hope you are not so behindhand in our news as not to
know. For me, I am not yet undone by the winter. I
still sit in my chair and walk about the room. But the
prison doors are shut close, and I could dash myself against
them sometimes with a passionate impatience of the need-less
captivity. I feel so intimately and from evidence, how,
with air and warmth together in any fair proportion, I
should be as well and happy as the rest of the world, that
it is intolerable&mdash;well, it is better to sympathise quietly with
Lady&mdash;and other energetic runaways, than amuse you
with being riotous to no end; and it is <i>best</i> to write one's
own epitaph still more quietly, is it not?...</p>

<p>And oh how lightly I write, and then sigh to think of
what different colours my spirits and my paper are. Do
you know what it is to laugh, that you may not cry? Yet I
hold a comfort fast.... Your very affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Saturday [February-March 1846].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Indeed it has been tantalising
and provoking to have you close by without being able to
gather a better advantage from it than the knowledge that
you were suffering. So passes the world and the glory of it.
I have been vexed into a high state of morality, I assure you.
Now that you are gone away I hear from you again; and it
does seem to me that almost always it happens so, and that
you come to London to be ill and leave it before you can
be well again. It is a comfort in every case to know of
your being better, and Hastings is warm and quiet, and the
pretty country all round (mind you go and see the 'Rocks'
<i>par excellence</i>)! will entice you into very gentle exercise.
At the same time, don't wish me into the house you speak
of. I can lose nothing here, shut up in my prison, and the
nightingales come to my windows and sing through the
sooty panes. If I were at Hastings I should risk the chance
of recovering liberty, and the consolations of slavery would
not reach me as they do here. Also, if I were to set my
heart upon Hastings, I might break it at leisure; there
would be exactly as much difficulty in turning my face that
way as towards Italy&mdash;ah, you do not understand! And
<i>I do, at last</i>, I am sorry to say; and it has been very long,
tedious and reluctant work, the learning of the lesson....</p>

<p>Did Henrietta tell you that I heard at last from Miss
Martineau, who thought me in Italy, she said, and therefore
was silent? She has sent me her new work (have you read
it?) and speaks of her strength and of being able to walk
fifteen miles a day, which seems to me like a fairy tale, or
the 'Three-leagued Boots' at least.</p>

<p>What am I doing, to tell you of? Nothing! The
winter is kind, and this divine 'muggy' weather (is <i>that</i> the
technical word and spelling thereof?), which gives all reasonable
people colds in their heads, leaves <i>me</i> the hope of
getting back to the summer without much injury. A friend
of mine&mdash;one of the greatest poets in England too&mdash;brought
me primroses and polyanthuses the other day, as they are
grown in Surrey!<a name="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> Surely it must be nearer spring than
we think.</p>

<p>Dearest Mrs. Martin, write and say how you are. And
say, God bless you, both the yous, and mention Mr. Martin
particularly, and what your plans are.</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Tuesday [end of June 1846].<br />

<p>So, my dearest Mrs. Martin, you are quite angry with all
of us and with me chiefly. Oh, you need not say no! I
see it, I understand it, and shall therefore take up my own
cause precisely as if I were an injured person. In the first
place, dearest Mrs. Martin, when you wrote to me (at last!)
to say that we were both guilty correspondents, you should
have spoken in the singular number; for I was not guilty
at all, I beg to say, while you were on the Continent. You
were uncertain, you said, on going, where you should go and
how long you should stay, and you promised to write and
give me some sort of address&mdash;a promise never kept&mdash;and
where was I to write to you? I heard for the first time,
from the Peytons, of your being at Pau, and then you were
expected at home. So innocent I am, and because it is
a pleasure rather rare to make a sincere profession of
innocence, I meant to write to you at least ten days ago;
and then (believe me you will, without difficulty) the dreadful
death of poor Mr. Haydon,<a name="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> the artist, quite upset me, and
made me disinclined to write a word beyond necessary ones.
I thank God that I never saw him&mdash;poor gifted Haydon&mdash;but,
a year and a half ago, we had a correspondence which
lasted through several months and was very pleasant while
it lasted. Then it was dropped, and only a few days before
the event he wrote three or four notes to me to ask me to
take charge of some papers and pictures, which I acceded
to as once I had done before. He was constantly in
pecuniary difficulty, and in apprehension of the seizure of
goods; and nothing of <i>fear</i> suggested itself to my
mind&mdash;nothing. The shock was very great. Oh! I do not write
to you to write of this. Only I would have you understand
the real case, and that it is not an excuse, and that it was
natural for me to be shaken a good deal. No artist is left
behind with equal largeness of poetical conception! If the
hand had always obeyed the soul, he would have been a
genius of the first order. As it is, he lived on the <i>slope</i> of
greatness and could not be steadfast and calm. His life
was one long agony of self-assertion. Poor, poor Haydon!
See how the world treats those who try too openly for its
gratitude! 'Tom Thumb for ever' over the heads of the
giants.</p>

<p>So you heard that I was quite well? Don't believe
everything you hear. But I am really in <i>a way</i> to be well,
if I could have such sunshine as we have been burning in
lately, and a fair field of peace besides. Generally, I am
able to go out every day, either walking or in the
carriage&mdash;'<i>walking</i>' means as far as Queen Anne's Street. The
wonderful winter did not cast me down, and the hot summer
helps me up higher. Now, to <i>keep in the sun</i> is the problem
to solve; and if I can do it, I shall be 'as well as anybody.'
If I can't, as ill as ever. Which is the <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of me, without
a word more....</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
June 27, 1846 [postmark].<br />

<p>Dearest Mr. Boyd,&mdash;Let me be clear of your reproaches
for not going to you this week. The truth is that I have
been so much shocked and shaken by the dreadful suicide
of poor Mr. Haydon, the artist, I had not spirits for it. He
was not personally my friend. I never saw him face to face.
But we had corresponded, and one of his last acts was an
act of <i>trust</i> towards me. Also I admired his genius. And
all to end <i>so</i>! It has naturally affected me much.</p>

<p>So I could not come, but in a few days I <i>will</i> come;
and in the meantime, I have had the sound of your voice to
think of, more than I could think of the deep melodious
bells, though they made the right and solemn impression.
How I felt, to be under your roof again!</p>

May God bless you, my very dear friend.<br />
These words in the greatest haste.<br />

<p>From your ever affectionate<br />

<p>It is now time to tell the story of the romance which, during
the last eighteen months, had entered into Elizabeth Barrett's
life, and was destined to divert its course into new and
happier channels. It is a story which fills one of the
brightest pages in English literary history.</p>

<p>The foregoing letters have shown something of Miss
Barrett's admiration for the poetry of Robert Browning, and
contain allusions to the beginning of their personal acquaintance.
Her knowledge of his poetry dates back to the
appearance of 'Paracelsus,' not to 'Pauline,' of which there
is no mention in her letters, and which had been practically
withdrawn from circulation by the author. Her personal
acquaintance with him was of much later date, and was
directly due to the publication of the 'Poems' in 1844.
Chancing to express his admiration of them to Mr. Kenyon,
who had been his friend since 1839 and his father's school-fellow
in years long distant, Mr. Browning was urged by him
to write to Miss Barrett himself, and tell her of his pleasure
in her work. Possibly the allusion to him in 'Lady
Geraldine's Courtship' may have been felt as furnishing an
excuse for addressing her; however that may be, he took
Mr. Kenyon's advice, and in January 1845 we find Miss
Barrett in 'ecstasies' over a letter (evidently the first) from
'Browning the poet, Browning the author of &quot;Paracelsus&quot;
and king of the mystics' (see p. 236, above).</p>

<p>The correspondence, once begun, continued to flourish,
and in the course of the same month Miss Barrett tells Mrs.
Martin that she is 'getting deeper and deeper into correspondence
with Robert Browning, poet and mystic; and we
are growing to be the truest of friends.' At the end of
May, when the return of summer brought her a renewal of
strength, they met face to face for the first time; and from
that time Robert Browning was included in the small list
of privileged friends who were admitted to visit her in person.</p>

<p>How this friendship ripened into love, and love into
courtship, it is not for us to inquire too closely. Something
has been told already in Mrs. Orr's 'Life of Robert
Browning;' something more is told in the long and
most interesting letter which stands first in the present
chapter. More precious than either is the record of her
fluctuating feelings which Mrs. Browning has enshrined for
ever in her 'Sonnets from the Portuguese,' and in the
handful of other poems&mdash;'Life and Love,' 'A Denial,'
'Proof and Disproof,' 'Inclusions,' 'Insufficiency,'<a name="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> which
likewise belong to this period and describe its hesitations,
its sorrows and its overwhelming joys. In the difficult circumstances
under which they were placed, the conduct of both
was without reproach. Mr. Browning knew that he was
asking to be allowed to take charge of an invalid's
life&mdash;believed indeed that she was even worse than was really
the case, and that she was hopelessly incapacitated from ever
standing on her feet&mdash;but was sure enough of his love to
regard that as no obstacle. Miss Barrett, for her part,
shrank from burdening the life of the man she loved with a
responsibility so trying and perhaps so painful, and refused
his unchanging devotion for his sake, not for her own.</p>

<p>The situation was complicated by the character of Mr.
Barrett, and by the certainty&mdash;for such it was to his
daughter&mdash;that he would refuse to entertain the idea of her
marriage, or, indeed, that of any of his children. The truth
of this view was absolutely vindicated not only in the case
of Elizabeth, but also in those of two others of the
family in later years. The reasons for his feeling it is
probable he could not have explained to himself. He was
fond of his family after his own fashion&mdash;proud, too, of his
daughter's genius; but he could not, it would seem, regard
them in any other light than as belonging to himself. The
wish to leave his roof and to enter into new relations was
looked upon as unfilial treachery; and no argument or persuasion
could shake him from his fixed idea. So long as
this disposition could be regarded as the result of a devoted
love of his children, it could be accepted with respect, if not
with full acquiescence; but circumstances brought the proof
that this was not the case, and thereby ultimately paved
the way to Elizabeth's marriage.</p>

<p>These circumstances are stated in several of her letters,
and alluded to in several others, but it may help to the
understanding of them if a brief summary be given here.
In the autumn of 1845, as described above, Miss Barrett's
doctors advised her to winter abroad. The advice was
strongly pressed, as offering a good prospect of a real
improvement of health, and as the only way of avoiding
the annual relapse brought on by the English winter.
One or more of her brothers could have gone with her,
and she was willing and able to try the experiment; but
in face of this express medical testimony, Mr. Barrett
interposed a refusal. This indifference to her health
naturally wounded Miss Barrett very deeply; but it also
gave her the right of taking her fate into her own hands.
Convinced at last that no refusal on her part could
alter Mr. Browning's devotion to her, and that marriage
with him, so far from being an increase of risk to her
health, offered the only means by which she might
hope for an improvement in it, she gave him the conditional
promise that if she came safely through the then impending
winter, she would consent to a definite engagement.</p>

<p>The winter of 1845-6 was an exceptionally mild one,
and she suffered less than usual; and in the spring of 1846
her lover claimed her promise. Throughout the summer
she continued to gain strength, being able, not only to
drive out, but even to walk short distances, and to visit a
few of her special friends such as Mr. Kenyon and Mr.
Boyd. Accordingly it was agreed that at the end of the
summer they should be married, and leave England for
Italy before the cold weather should return. The uselessness
of asking her father's consent was so evident, and the
certainty that it would only result in the exclusion of Mr.
Browning from the house so clear, that no attempt was
made to obtain it. Only her two sisters were aware of what
was going on; but even they were not informed of the final
arrangements for the marriage, in order that they might
not be involved in their father's anger when it should
become known. For the same reason the secret was kept
from so close a friend of both parties as Mr. Kenyon;
though both he and Mr. Boyd, and possibly also Mrs.
Jameson, had suspicions amounting to different degrees of
certainty as to the real state of affairs. It had been
intended that they should wait until the end of September,
but a project for a temporary removal of the family into
the country precipitated matters; and on September 12,
accompanied only by her maid, Wilson, Miss Barrett slipped
from the house and was married to Robert Browning
in Marylebone Church.<a name="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> The associations which that
ponderous edifice has gained from this act for all lovers of
English poetry tempt one to forgive its unromantic appearance,
and to remember rather the pilgrimages which
Robert Browning on his subsequent visits to England
never failed to pay to its threshold.</p>

<p>For a week after the marriage Mrs. Browning&mdash;by which
more familiar name we now have the right to call
her&mdash;remained in her father's house; her husband refraining
from seeing her, since he could not now ask for her by
her proper name without betraying their secret. Then,
on September 19, accompanied once more by her maid and
the ever-beloved Flushie, she left her home, to which she
was never to return, crossed the Channel with her husband
to Havre, and so travelled on to Paris. Her father's anger,
if not loud, was deep and unforgiving. From that moment
he cast her off and disowned her. He would not read or
open her letters; he would not see her when she returned
to England. Even the birth of her child brought no
relenting; he expressed no sympathy or anxiety, he would
not look upon its face. He died as he lived, unrelenting,
cut off by his own unbending anger from a daughter who
could with difficulty bring herself to speak a harsh word of
him, even to her most intimate friends.</p>

<p>It was a more unexpected and consequently an even
more bitter blow to find that her brothers at first disapproved
of her action; the more so, since they had sympathised with
her in the struggle of the previous autumn. This disapprobation
was, however, less deep-seated, resting partly upon
doubts as to the practical prudence of the match, partly, no
doubt, upon a natural annoyance at having been kept in the
dark. Such an estrangement could only be temporary, and
as time went on was replaced by a full renewal of the old
affection towards herself and a friendly acceptance of her
husband. With her sisters, on the other hand, there was
never a shadow of difference or estrangement. That love
remained unaffected; and almost the only circumstance
that caused Mrs. Browning to regret her enforced absence
from England was the separation which it entailed from
her two sisters.</p>

<p>In Paris the fugitives found a friend who proved a friend
indeed. A few weeks earlier Mrs. Jameson, knowing of
the needs of Miss Barrett's health, had offered to take her
to Italy; but her offer had been refused. Her astonishment
may be imagined when, after this short interval of
time, she found her invalid friend in Paris as the wife of
Robert Browning. The prospect filled her with almost as
much dismay as pleasure. 'I have here,' she wrote to a
friend from Paris, 'a poet and a poetess&mdash;two celebrities who
have run away and married under circumstances peculiarly
interesting, and such as to render imprudence the height of
prudence. Both excellent; but God help them! for I
know not how the two poet heads and poet hearts will get
on through this prosaic world.'<a name="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> Mrs. Jameson, who was
travelling with her young niece, Miss Geraldine Bate,<a name="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> lent
her aid to smooth the path of her poet friends, and it was
in her company that, after a week's rest in Paris, the
Brownings proceeded on their journey to Italy. It is easy
to imagine what a comfort her presence must have been to
the invalid wife and her naturally anxious husband; and
this journey sealed a friendship of no ordinary depth and
warmth. Mrs. Browning bore the journey wonderfully,
though suffering much from fatigue. During a rest of two
days at Avignon, a pilgrimage was made to Vaucluse, in
honour of Petrarch and his Laura; and there, as Mrs.
Macpherson has recorded in an often quoted passage of
her biography of her aunt, 'there, at the very source of the
&quot;chiare, fresche e dolci acque,&quot; Mr. Browning took his
wife up in his arms, and carrying her across the shallow,
curling water, seated her on a rock that rose throne-like
in the middle of the stream. Thus love and poetry
took a new possession of the spot immortalised by
Petrarch's loving fancy.'<a name="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p>So at the beginning of October the party reached
Pisa; and there the newly wedded pair settled for the
winter. Here first since the departure from London was
there leisure to renew the intercourse with friends at home,
to answer congratulations and good wishes, to explain what
might seem strange and unaccountable. From this point
Mrs. Browning's correspondence contains nearly a full
record of her life, and can be left to tell its own story in
better language than the biographer's. The first letter to
Mrs. Martin is an 'apologia pro connubio suo' in fullest
detail; the others carry on the story from the point at
which that leaves it.</p>

<p>With regard to this first letter, full as it is of the
most intimate personal and family revelations, it has
seemed right to give it entire. The marriage of Robert and
Elizabeth Browning has passed into literary history, and it
is only fair that it should be set, once for all, in its true
light. Those who might be pained by any expressions in it
have passed away; and those in whose character and reputation
the lovers of English literature are interested have
nothing to fear from the fullest revelation. If anything
were kept back, false and injurious surmises might be
formed; the truth leaves little room for controversy, and
none for slander.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Collegio Ferdinando, Pisa; October 20(?), 1846.<a name="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a><br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Will you believe that I began
a letter to you before I took this step, to give you the whole
story of the impulses towards it, feeling strongly that I
owed what I considered my justification to such dear friends
as yourself and Mr. Martin, that you might not hastily conclude
that you had thrown away upon one who was quite
unworthy the regard of years? I had begun such a letter&mdash;when,
by the plan of going to Little Bookham, my plans
were all hurried forward&mdash;changed&mdash;driven prematurely into
action, and the last hours of agitation and deep anguish&mdash;for
it was the deepest of its kind, to leave Wimpole Street
and those whom I tenderly loved&mdash;<i>so</i> would not admit of
my writing or thinking: only I was able to think that my
beloved sisters would send you some account of me when I
was gone. And now I hear from them that your generosity
has not waited for a letter from me to do its best for me, and
that instead of being vexed, as you might well be, at my
leaving England without a word sent to you, you have used
kind offices in my behalf, you have been more than the
generous and affectionate friend I always considered you.
So my first words must be that I am deeply grateful to you,
my very dear friend, and that to the last moment of my life
I shall remember the claim you have on my gratitude.
Generous people are inclined to acquit generously; but it
has been very painful to me to observe that with all my mere
friends I have found more sympathy and <i>trust</i>, than in
those who are of my own household and who have been
daily witnesses of my life. I do not say this for papa,
who is peculiar and in a peculiar position; but it pained
me that&mdash;&mdash;, who <i>knew</i> all that passed last year&mdash;for
instance, about Pisa&mdash;who knew that the alternative of
making a single effort to secure my health during the
winter was the severe displeasure I have incurred now,
and that the fruit of yielding myself a prisoner was the
sense of being of no use nor comfort to any soul; papa
having given up coming to see me except for five minutes,
a day; ==&mdash;, who said to me with his own lips, 'He does
not love you&mdash;do not think it' (said and repeated it two
months ago)&mdash;that &mdash;&mdash; should now turn round and reproach
me for want of affection towards my family, for not letting
myself drop like a dead weight into the abyss, a sacrifice
without an object and expiation&mdash;this did surprise me
and pain me&mdash;pained me more than all papa's dreadful words.
But the personal feeling is nearer with most of us than
the tenderest feeling for another; and my family had been
so accustomed to the idea of my living on and on in that
room, that while my heart was eating itself, their love for me
was consoled, and at last the evil grew scarcely perceptible.
It was no want of love in them, and quite natural in itself:
we all get used to the thought of a tomb; and I was buried,
that was the whole. It was a little thing even for myself a
short time ago, and really it would be a pneumatological
curiosity if I could describe and let you see how perfectly
for years together, after what broke my heart at Torquay, I
lived on the outside of my own life, blindly and darkly
from day to day, as completely dead to hope of any kind
as if I had my face against a grave, never feeling a personal
instinct, taking trains of thought to carry out as an occupation
absolutely indifferent to the <i>me</i> which is in every
human being. Nobody quite understood this of me,
because I am not morally a coward, and have a hatred of
all the forms of audible groaning. But God knows what is
within, and how utterly I had abdicated myself and thought
it not worth while to put out my finger to touch my share of
life. Even my poetry, which suddenly grew an interest,
was a thing on the outside of me, a thing to be done, and
then done! What people said of it did not touch <i>me</i>. A
thoroughly morbid and desolate state it was, which I look
back now to with the sort of horror with which one would
look to one's graveclothes, if one had been clothed in them
by mistake during a trance.</p>

<p>And now I will tell you. It is nearly two years ago since
I have known Mr. Browning. Mr. Kenyon wished to bring
him to see me five years ago, as one of the lions of London
who roared the gentlest and was best worth my knowing;
but I refused then, in my blind dislike to seeing strangers.
Immediately, however, after the publication of my last
volumes, he wrote to me, and we had a correspondence
which ended in my agreeing to receive him as I never had
received any other man. I did not know why, but it was
utterly impossible for me to refuse to receive him, though
I consented against my will. He writes the most exquisite
letters possible, and has a way of putting things
which I have not, a way of putting aside&mdash;so he came.
He came, and with our personal acquaintance began his
attachment for me, a sort of <i>infatuation</i> call it, which
resisted the various denials which were my plain duty at the
beginning, and has persisted past them all. I began with&mdash;a
grave assurance that I was in an exceptional position
and saw him just in consequence of it, and that if ever he
recurred to that subject again I never could see him again
while I lived; and he believed me and was silent. To my
mind, indeed, it was a bare impulse&mdash;a generous man of
quick sympathies taking up a sudden interest with both
hands! So I thought; but in the meantime the letters
and the visits rained down more and more, and in every one
there was something which was too slight to analyse and
notice, but too decided not to be understood; so that at
last, when the 'proposed respect' of the silence gave way,
it was rather less dangerous. So then I showed him how
he was throwing into the ashes his best affections&mdash;how
the common gifts of youth and cheerfulness were behind
me&mdash;how I had not strength, even of <i>heart</i>, for the ordinary
duties of life&mdash;everything I told him and showed him. 'Look
at this&mdash;and this,' throwing down all my disadvantages.
To which he did not answer by a single
compliment, but simply that he had not then to choose,
and that I might be right or he might be right, he was
not there to decide; but that he loved me and should to
his last hour. He said that the freshness of youth had
passed with him also, and that he had studied the world
out of books and seen many women, yet had never loved
one until he had seen me. That he knew himself, and
knew that, if ever so repulsed, he should love me to his
last hour&mdash;it should be first and last. At the same time,
he would not tease me, he would wait twenty years if I
pleased, and then, if life lasted so long for both of us, then
when it was ending perhaps, I might understand him and
feel that I might have trusted him. For my health, he had
believed when he first spoke that I was suffering from an
incurable injury of the spine, and that he never could hope
to see me stand up before his face, and he appealed to my
womanly sense of what a pure attachment should be&mdash;whether
such a circumstance, if it had been true, was inconsistent
with it. He preferred, he said, of free and deliberate choice,
to be allowed to sit only an hour a day by my side, to the
fulfilment of the brightest dream which should exclude me, in
any possible world.</p>

<p>I tell you so much, my ever dear friend, that you may
see the manner of man I have had to do with, and the sort
of attachment which for nearly two years has been drawing
and winning me. I know better than any in the world,
indeed, what Mr. Kenyon once unconsciously said before
me&mdash;that 'Robert Browning is great in everything.' Then,
when you think how this element of an affection so pure
and persistent, cast into my dreary life, must have acted on
it&mdash;how little by little I was drawn into the persuasion that
something was left, and that still I could do something to
the happiness of another&mdash;and he what he was, for I have
deprived myself of the privilege of praising him&mdash;then it
seemed worth while to take up with that unusual energy (for
me!), expended in vain last year, the advice of the physicians
that I should go to a warm climate for the winter. Then
came the Pisa conflict of last year. For years I had looked
with a sort of indifferent expectation towards Italy, knowing
and feeling that I should escape there the annual relapse,
yet, with that <i>laisser aller</i> manner which had become a
habit to me, unable to form a definite wish about it. But
last year, when all this happened to me, and I was better
than usual in the summer, I <i>wished</i> to make the experiment&mdash;to
live the experiment out, and see whether there was
hope for me or not hope. Then came Dr. Chambers, with his
encouraging opinion. 'I wanted simply a warm climate and
<i>air</i>,' he said; 'I might be well if I pleased.' Followed what
you know&mdash;or do not precisely know&mdash;the pain of it was
acutely felt by me; for I never had doubted but that papa
would catch at any human chance of restoring my health.
I was under the delusion always that the difficulty of
making such trials lay in <i>me</i>, and not in <i>him</i>. His manner
of acting towards me last summer was one of the most
painful griefs of my life, because it involved a disappointment
in the affections. My dear father is a very peculiar
person. He is naturally stern, and has exaggerated notions
of authority, but these things go with high and noble
qualities; and as for feeling, the water is under the rock,
and I had faith. Yes, and have it. I admire such qualities
as he has&mdash;fortitude, integrity. I loved him for his courage
in adverse circumstances which were yet felt by him more
literally than I could feel them. Always he has had the
greatest power over my heart, because I am of those weak
women who reverence strong men. By a word he might
have bound me to him hand and foot. Never has he
spoken a gentle word to me or looked a kind look which
has not made in me large results of gratitude, and throughout
my illness the sound of his step on the stairs has had
the power of quickening my pulse&mdash;I have loved him so
and love him. Now if he had said last summer that he was
reluctant for me to leave him&mdash;if he had even allowed me
to think <i>by mistake</i> that his affection for me was the
motive of such reluctance&mdash;I was ready to give up Pisa in
a moment, and I told him as much. Whatever my new
impulses towards life were, my love for him (taken so)
would have resisted all&mdash;I loved him so dearly. But his
course was otherwise, quite otherwise, and I was wounded
to the bottom of my heart&mdash;cast off when I was ready to
cling to him. In the meanwhile, at my side was another;
I was driven and I was drawn. Then at last I said, 'If
you like to let this winter decide it, you may. I will allow
of no promises nor engagement. I cannot go to Italy, and
I know, as nearly as a human creature can know any fact,
that I shall be ill again through the influence of this
English winter. If I am, you will see plainer the foolishness
of this persistence; if I am not, I will do what you
please.' And his answer was, 'If you are ill and keep
your resolution of not marrying me under those circumstances,
I will keep mine and love you till God shall take
us both.' This was in last autumn, and the winter came
with its miraculous mildness, as you know, and I was saved
as I dared not hope; my word therefore was claimed in
the spring. Now do you understand, and will you feel for
me? An application to my father was certainly the obvious
course, if it had not been for his peculiar nature and my
peculiar position. But there is no speculation in the case;
it is a matter of <i>knowledge</i> that if Robert had applied to
him in the first instance he would have been forbidden the
house without a moment's scruple; and if in the last (as my
sisters thought best as a respectable <i>form</i>), I should have
been incapacitated from any after-exertion by the horrible
scenes to which, as a thing of course, I should have been
exposed. Papa will not bear some subjects, it is a thing
<i>known</i>; his peculiarity takes that ground to the largest.
Not one of his children will ever marry without a breach,
which we all know, though he probably does not&mdash;deceiving
himself in a setting up of <i>obstacles</i>, whereas the real obstacle
is in his own mind. In my case there was, or would have
been, a great deal of apparent reason to hold by; my
health would have been motive enough&mdash;ostensible motive.
I see that precisely as others may see it. Indeed, if I were
charged now with want of generosity for casting myself so,
a dead burden, on the man I love, nothing of the sort
could surprise me. It was what occurred to myself, that
thought was, and what occasioned a long struggle and
months of agitation, and which nothing could have overcome
but the very uncommon affection of a very uncommon
person, reasoning out to me the great fact of love making
its own level. As to vanity and selfishness blinding me,
certainly I may have made a mistake, and the future may
prove it, but still more certainly I was not blinded <i>so</i>. On
the contrary, never have I been more humbled, and never
less in danger of considering any personal pitiful advantage,
than throughout this affair. You, who are generous and a
woman, will believe this of me, even if you do not comprehend
the <i>habit</i> I had fallen into of casting aside the
consideration of possible happiness of my own. But I was
speaking of papa. Obvious it was that the application to
him was a mere form. I knew the result of it. I had
made up my mind to act upon my full right of taking my
own way. I had long believed such an act (the most
strictly personal act of one's life) to be within the rights of
every person of mature age, man or woman, and I had
resolved to exercise that right in my own case by a resolution
which had slowly ripened. All the other doors of
life were shut to me, and shut me in as in a prison, and
only before this door stood one whom I loved best and
who loved me best, and who invited me out through it for
the good's sake which he thought I could do him. Now if
for the sake of the mere form I had applied to my father,
and if, as he would have done directly, he had set up his
'curse' against the step I proposed to take, would it have
been doing otherwise than placing a knife in his hand? A
few years ago, merely through the reverberation of what he
said to another on a subject like this, I fell on the floor in
a fainting fit, and was almost delirious afterwards. I
cannot bear some words. I would much rather have
blows without them. In my actual state of nerves and
physical weakness, it would have been the sacrifice of my
whole life&mdash;of my convictions, of my affections, and,
above all, of what the person dearest to me persisted in
calling <i>his</i> life, and the good of it&mdash;if I had observed that
'form.' Therefore, wrong or right, I determined not to
observe it, and, wrong or right, I did and do consider that
in not doing so I sinned against no duty. That I was <i>constrained</i>
to act clandestinely, and did not <i>choose</i> to do so,
God is witness, and will set it down as my heavy misfortune
and not my fault. Also, up to the very last act we stood in
the light of day for the whole world, if it pleased, to judge
us. I never saw him out of the Wimpole Street house; he
came twice a week to see me&mdash;or rather, three times in the
fortnight, openly in the sight of all, and this for nearly
two years, and neither more nor less. Some jests used to
be passed upon us by my brothers, and I allowed them
without a word, but it would have been infamous in me to
have taken any into my confidence who would have
suffered, as a direct consequence, a blighting of his own
prospects. My secrecy towards them all was my simple
duty towards them all, and what they call want of affection
was an affectionate consideration for them. My sisters did
indeed know the truth to a certain point. They knew of
the attachment and engagement&mdash;I could not help that&mdash;but
the whole of the event I kept from them with a strength
and resolution which really I did not know to be in me,
and of which nothing but a sense of the injury to be done
to them by a fuller confidence, and my tender gratitude and
attachment to them for all their love and goodness, could
have rendered me capable. Their faith in me, and undeviating
affection for me, I shall be grateful for to the end
of my existence, and to the extent of my power of feeling
gratitude. My dearest sisters!&mdash;especially, let me say, my
own beloved Arabel, who, with no consolation except the
exercise of a most generous tenderness, has looked only to
what she considered my good&mdash;never doubting me, never
swerving for one instant in her love for me. May God
reward her as I cannot. Dearest Henrietta loves me too,
but loses less in me, and has reasons for not misjudging
me. But both my sisters have been faultless in their bearing
towards me, and never did I love them so tenderly as I love
them now.</p>

<p>The only time I met R.B. clandestinely was in the
parish church, where we were married before two witnesses&mdash;it
was the first and only time. I looked, he says, more
dead than alive, and can well believe it, for I all but
fainted on the way, and had to stop for sal volatile at a
chemist's shop. The support through it all was <i>my trust
in him</i>, for no woman who ever committed a like act of
trust has had stronger motives to hold by. Now may I not
tell you that his genius, and all but miraculous attainments,
are the least things in him, the moral nature being
of the very noblest, as all who ever knew him admit?
Then he has had that wide experience of men which ends
by throwing the mind back on itself and God; there is
nothing incomplete in him, except as all humanity is
incompleteness. The only wonder is how such a man,
whom any woman could have loved, should have loved
<i>me</i>; but men of genius, you know, are apt to love with
their imagination. Then there is something in the sympathy,
the strange, straight sympathy which unites us on all
subjects. If it were not that I look up to him, we should
be too alike to be together perhaps, but I know my place
better than he does, who is too humble. Oh, you cannot
think how well we get on after six weeks of marriage. If I
suffer again it will not be through <i>him</i>. Some day, dearest
Mrs. Martin, I will show you and dear Mr. Martin how his
<i>prophecy was fulfilled</i>, saving some picturesque particulars.
I did not know before that Saul was among the prophets.</p>

<p>My poor husband suffered very much from the constraint
imposed on him by my position, and did, for the
first time in his life, for my sake do that in secret which
he could not speak upon the housetops. <i>Mea culpa</i> all of
it! If one of us two is to be blamed, it is I, at whose
representation of circumstances he submitted to do violence
to his own self-respect. I would not suffer him to
tell even our dear common friend Mr. Kenyon. I felt that
it would be throwing on dear Mr. Kenyon a painful
responsibility, and involve him in the blame ready to fall.
And dear dear Mr. Kenyon, like the noble, generous
friend I love so deservedly, comprehends all at a word,
sends us <i>not</i> his forgiveness, but his sympathy, his
affection, the kindest words which can be written! I
cannot tell you all his inexpressible kindness to us both.
He justifies us to the uttermost, and, in that, all the
grateful attachment we had, each on our side, so long
professed towards him. Indeed, in a note I had from him
yesterday, he uses this strong expression after gladly
speaking of our successful journey: 'I considered that you
had <i>perilled your life</i> upon this undertaking, and, reflecting
upon your last position, I thought that <i>you had done well</i>.'
But my life was not perilled in the journey. The agitation
and fatigue were evils, to be sure, and Mrs. Jameson, who
met us in Paris by a happy accident, thought me 'looking
horribly ill' at first, and persuaded us to rest there for a
week on the promise of accompanying us herself to Pisa
to help Robert to take care of me. He, who was in a fit of
terror about me, agreed at once, and so she came with us,
she and her young niece, and her kindness leaves us both
very grateful. So kind she was, and is&mdash;for still she is in
Pisa&mdash;opening her arms to us and calling us 'children of
light' instead of ugly names, and declaring that she should
have been 'proud' to have had anything to do with our
marriage. Indeed, we hear every day kind speeches and
messages from people such as Mr. Chorley of the 'Athenaeum,'
who 'has tears in his eyes,' Monckton Milnes,
Barry Cornwall, and other friends of my husband's, but who
only know <i>me</i> by my books, and I want the love and
sympathy of those who love me and whom I love. I was
talking of the influence of the journey. The change of air
has done me wonderful good notwithstanding the fatigue,
and I am renewed to the point of being able to throw off
most of my invalid habits; and of walking quite like a
woman. Mrs. Jameson said the other day, 'You are not
<i>improved</i>, you are <i>transformed</i>.' We have most
comfortable rooms here at Pisa and have taken them for six
months, in the best situation for health, and close to the
Duomo and Leaning Tower. It is a beautiful, solemn
city, and we have made acquaintance with Professor
Ferucci, who is about to admit us to [a sight]<a name="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> of the
[University Lib]rary. We shall certainly [spend] next
summer in Italy <i>somewhere</i>, and [talk] of Rome for the
next winter, but, of course, this is all in air. Let me hear</p>

<p>from you, dearest Mrs. Martin, and direct, 'M. Browning,
Poste Restante, Pisa'&mdash;it is best. Just before we left Paris
I wrote to my aunt Jane, and from Marseilles to Bummy,
but from neither have I heard yet.</p>

<p>With best love to dearest Mr. Martin, ever both my
dear kind friends,</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Miss Mitford</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a><br />
Moulins: October 2, 1846.<br />

<p>I began to write to you, my beloved friend, earlier, that
I might follow your kindest wishes literally, and also to
thank you at once for your goodness to me, for which may
God bless you. But the fatigue and agitation have been
very great, and I was forced to break off&mdash;as now I dare not
revert to what is behind. I will tell you more another
day. At Orleans, with your kindest letter, I had one from
my dearest, gracious friend Mr. Kenyon, who, in his goodness,
does more than exculpate&mdash;even <i>approves</i>&mdash;he wrote
a joint letter to both of us. But oh, the anguish I have
gone through! You are good, you are kind. I thank
you from the bottom of my heart for saying to me that you
would have gone to the church with me. <i>Yes, I know you
would</i>. And for that very reason I forbore involving you
in such a responsibility and drawing you into such a net.
I took Wilson with me. I had courage to keep the secret
to my sisters for their sakes, though I will tell you in strict
confidence that it was known to them <i>potentially</i>, that is,
the attachment and engagement were known, the necessity
remaining that, for stringent reasons affecting their own
tranquillity, they should be able to say at last, 'We were not
instructed in this and this.' The dearest, fondest, most
affectionate of sisters they are to me, and if the sacrifice of
a life, or of all prospect of happiness, would have worked
any lasting good to them, it should have been made even
in the hour I left them. I knew <i>that</i> by the anguish I
suffered in it. But a sacrifice, without good to anyone&mdash;I
shrank from it. And also, it was the sacrifice of <i>two</i>. And
<i>he</i>, as you say, had done everything for me, had loved me
for reasons which had helped to weary me of myself, loved
me heart to heart persistently&mdash;in spite of my own will&mdash;drawn
me back to life and hope again when I had done
with both. My life seemed to belong to him and to none
other at last, and I had no power to speak a word. Have
faith in me, my dearest friend, till you can know him.
The intellect is so little in comparison to all the rest, to the
womanly tenderness, the inexhaustible goodness, the high
and noble aspiration of every hour. Temper, spirits,
manners: there is not a flaw anywhere. I shut my eyes
sometimes and fancy it all a dream of my guardian angel.
Only, if it had been a dream, the pain of some parts of it
would have awakened me before now; it is not a dream.
I have borne all the emotion of fatigue miraculously well,
though, of course, a good deal exhausted at times. We
had intended to hurry on to the South at once, but at
Paris we met Mrs. Jameson, who opened her arms to us
with the most literal affectionateness, <i>kissed us both</i>, and
took us by surprise by calling us 'wise people, wild poets
or not.' Moreover, she fixed us in an apartment above her
own in the H&ocirc;tel de la Ville de Paris, that I might rest for
a week, and crowned the rest of her goodnesses by agreeing
to accompany us to Pisa, where she was about to travel
with her young niece. Therefore we are five travelling,
Wilson being with me. Oh, yes, Wilson came; her attachment
to me never shrank for a moment. And Flush came
and I assure you that nearly as much attention has been
paid to Flush as to me from the beginning, so that he is
perfectly reconciled, and would be happy if the people at the
railroads were not barbarians, and immovable in their evil
designs of shutting him up in a box when we travel that
way.</p>

<p>You understand now, ever dearest Miss Mitford, how
the pause has come about writing. The week at Paris!
Such a strange week it was, altogether like a vision.
Whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell
scarcely. Our Balzac should be flattered beyond measure
by my thinking of him at all. Which I did, but of <i>you</i>
more. I will write and tell you more about Paris. You
should go there indeed. And to our hotel, if at all. Once
we were at the Louvre, but we kept very still of course, and
were satisfied with the <i>idea</i> of Paris. I could have
borne to live on there, it was all so strange and full of contrast....</p>

<p>Now you will write&mdash;I feel my way on the paper to
write this. Nothing is changed between us, nothing can
ever interfere with sacred confidences, remember. I do
not show letters, you need not fear my turning traitress....
Pray for me, dearest friend, that the bitterness of old affections
may not be too bitter with me, and that God may turn those
salt waters sweet again.</p>

<p>Pray for your grateful and loving<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
[Pisa:] November 5, [1846].<br />

<p>It was pleasant to me, my dearest friend, to think while
I was reading your letter yesterday, that almost by that
time you had received mine, and could not even seem to
doubt a moment longer whether I admitted your claim of
hearing and of speaking to the uttermost. I recognised you
too entirely as my friend. Because you had put faith in me,
so much the more reason there was that I should justify it
as far as I could, and with as much frankness (which was a
part of my gratitude to you) as was possible from a woman
to a woman. Always I have felt that you have believed in
me and loved me; and, for the sake of the past and of the
present, your affection and your esteem are more to me
than I could afford to lose, even in these changed and
happy circumstances. So I thank you once more, my dear
kind friends, I thank you both&mdash;I never shall forget your
goodness. I feel it, of course, the more deeply, in proportion
to the painful disappointment in other quarters.... Am I,
bitter? The feeling, however, passes while I write it out,
and my own affection for everybody will wait patiently to
be 'forgiven' in the proper form, when everybody shall be
at leisure properly. Assuredly, in the meanwhile, however,
my case is not to be classed with other cases&mdash;what
happened to me could not have happened, perhaps, with
any other family in England.... I hate and loathe everything
too which is clandestine&mdash;we <i>both</i> do, Robert and I;
and the manner the whole business was carried on in
might have instructed the least acute of the bystanders.
The flowers standing perpetually on my table for the last
two years were brought there by one hand, as everybody
knew; and really it would have argued an excess of benevolence
in an unmarried man with quite enough resources
in London, to pay the continued visits he paid to me without
some strong motive indeed. Was it his fault that he
did not associate with everybody in the house as well as
with me? He desired it; but no&mdash;that was not to be. The
endurance of the pain of the position was not the least
proof of his attachment to me. How I thank you for
believing in him&mdash;how grateful it makes me! He will
justify to the uttermost that faith. We have been married
two months, and every hour has bound me to him more and
more; if the beginning was well, still better it is now&mdash;that
is what he says to me, and I say back again day by day.
Then it is an 'advantage,' to have an inexhaustible companion
who talks wisdom of all things in heaven and earth,
and shows besides as perpetual a good humour and gaiety
as if he were&mdash;a fool, shall I say? or a considerable quantity
more, perhaps. As to our domestic affairs, it is not to
<i>my</i> honour and glory that the 'bills' are made up every
week and paid more regularly 'than hard beseems,' while
dear Mrs. Jameson laughs outright at our miraculous
prudence and economy, and declares that it is past belief
and precedent that we should not burn the candles at both
ends, and the next moment will have it that we remind her
of the children in a poem of Heine's who set up housekeeping
in a tub, and inquired gravely the price of coffee.
Ah, but she has left Pisa at last&mdash;left it yesterday. It was
a painful parting to everybody. Seven weeks spent in such
close neighbourhood&mdash;a month of it under the same roof
and in the same carriages&mdash;will fasten people together, and
then travelling <i>shakes</i> them together. A more affectionate,
generous woman never lived than Mrs. Jameson, and it is
pleasant to be sure that she loves us both from her heart,
and not only <i>du bout des l&egrave;vres</i>. Think of her making
Robert promise (as he has told me since) that in the case
of my being unwell he would write to her instantly, and she
would come at once if anywhere in Italy. So kind, so like
her. She spends the winter in Rome, but an intermediate
month at Florence, and we are to keep tryst with her somewhere
in the spring, perhaps at Venice. If not, she says
that she will come back here, for that certainly she will see
us. She would have stayed altogether perhaps, if it had
not been for her book upon art which she is engaged to
bring out next year, and the materials for which are to be
<i>sought</i>. As to Pisa, she liked it just as we like it. Oh, it is
so beautiful and so full of repose, yet not <i>desolate</i>: it is
rather the repose of sleep than of death. Then after the
first ten days of rain, which seemed to refer us fatally to
Alfieri's 'piove e ripiove,' came as perpetual a divine sunshine,
such cloudless, exquisite weather that we ask
whether it may not be June instead of November. Every
day I am out walking while the golden oranges look at me
over the walls, and when I am tired Robert and I sit down
on a stone to watch the lizards. We have been to your
seashore, too, and seen your island, only he insists on it
(Robert does) that it is not Corsica but Gorgona, and that
Corsica is not in sight. <i>Beautiful</i> and blue the island was,
however, in any case. It might have been Romero's instead
of either. Also we have driven up to the foot of mountains,
and seen them reflected down in the little pure lake of
Ascuno, and we have seen the pine woods, and met the
camels laden with faggots all in a line. So now ask me
again if I enjoy my liberty as you expect. My head goes
round sometimes, that is all. I never was happy before in
my life. Ah, but, of course, the painful thoughts recur!</p>

<p>There are some whom I love too tenderly to be easy under
their displeasure, or even under their injustice. Only it,
seems to me that with time and patience my poor dearest
papa will be melted into opening his arms to us&mdash;will
be melted into a clearer understanding of motives and
intentions; I cannot believe that he will forget me, as
he says he will, and go on thinking me to be dead rather
than alive and happy. So I manage to hope for the best,
and all that remains, all my life here, <i>is</i> best already, could
not be better or happier. And willingly tell dear Mr.
Martin I would take him and you for witnesses of it, and in
the meanwhile he is not to send me tantalising messages;
no, indeed, unless you really, really, should let yourselves be
wafted our way, and could you do so much better at Pau?
particularly if Fanny Hanford should come here. Will she
really? The climate is described by the inhabitants as a
'pleasant spring throughout the winter,' and if you were to
see Robert and me threading our path along the shady side
everywhere to avoid the 'excessive heat of the sun' in this
November (!) it would appear a good beginning. We are
not in the warm orthodox position by the Arno because we
heard with our ears one of the best physicians of the place
advise against it. 'Better,' he said, 'to have cool rooms to
live in and warm walks to go out along.' The rooms we
have are rather over-cool perhaps; we are obliged to have
a little fire in the sitting-room, in the mornings and evenings
that is; but I do not fear for the winter, there is too much
difference to my feelings between this November and any
English November I ever knew. We have our dinner from
the Trattoria at two o'clock, and can dine our favorite way
on thrushes and chianti with a miraculous cheapness, and
no trouble, no cook, no kitchen; the prophet Elijah or the
lilies of the field took as little thought for their dining,
which exactly suits us. It is a continental fashion which we
never cease commending. Then at six we have coffee, and
rolls of milk, made of milk, I mean, and at nine our supper
(call it supper, if you please) of roast chestnuts and grapes.
So you see how primitive we are, and how I forget to praise
the eggs at breakfast. The worst of Pisa is, or would be to
some persons, that, socially speaking, it has its dullnesses;
it is not lively like Florence, not in that way. But we do
not want society, we shun it rather. We like the Duomo
and the Campo Santo instead. Then we know a little of
Professor Ferucci, who gives us access to the University
library, and we subscribe to a modern one, and we have
plenty of writing to do of our own. If we can do anything
for Fanny Hanford, let us know. It would be too happy,
I suppose, to have to do it for yourselves. Think, however,
I am quite well, quite well. I can thank God, too, for being
alive and well. Make dear Mr. Martin keep well, and not
forget himself in the Herefordshire cold&mdash;draw him into the
sun somewhere. Now write and tell me everything of your
plans and of you both, dearest friends. My husband bids
me say that he desires to have my friends for his own friends,
and that he is grateful to you for not crossing that feeling. Let
him send his regards to you. And let me be throughout all
changes,</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
[Pisa]: November 5, 1846.<br />

<p>I have your letter, ever dearest Miss Mitford, and it is
welcome even more than your letters have been used to be
to me&mdash;the last charm was to come, you see, by this distance.
For all your affection and solicitude, may you trust
my gratitude; and if you love me a little, I love you indeed,
and never shall cease. The only difference shall be that two
may love you where one did, and for my part I will answer
for it that if you could love the poor one you will not refuse
any love to the other when you come to know him. I never
could bear to speak to you of <i>him</i> since quite the beginning,
or rather I never could dare. But when you know him and
understand how the mental gifts are scarcely half of him,
you will not wonder at your friend, and, indeed, two
years of steadfast affection from such a man would have,
overcome any woman's heart. I have been neither much
wiser nor much foolisher than all the shes in the world, only
much happier&mdash;the difference is in the happiness. Certainly
I am not likely to repent of having given myself to him. I
cannot, for all the pain received from another quarter, the
comfort for which is that my conscience is pure of the sense
of having broken the least known duty, and that the same
consequence would follow any marriage of any member of
my family with any possible man or woman. I look to
time, and reason, and natural love and pity, and to the
justification of the events acting through all; I look on so
and hope, and in the meanwhile it has been a great comfort
to have had not merely the indulgence but the approbation
and sympathy of most of my old personal friends&mdash;oh, such
kind letters; for instance, yesterday one came from dear
Mrs. Martin, who has known me, she and her husband, since
the very beginning of my womanhood, and both of them
are acute, thinking people, with heads as strong as their
hearts. I in my haste left England without a word to them,
for which they might naturally have reproached me; instead
of which they write to say that never <i>for a moment</i> have
they doubted my having acted for the best and happiest,
and to assure me that, having sympathised with me in every
sorrow and trial, they delightedly feel with me in the new
joy; nothing could be more cordially kind. See how I
write to you as if I could speak&mdash;all these little things which
are great things when seen in the light. Also R, and I
are not in the least tired of one another notwithstanding
the very perpetual <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> into which we have fallen, and
which (past the first fortnight) would be rather a trial in
many cases. Then our housekeeping may end perhaps in
being a proverb among the nations, for at the beginning it
makes Mrs. Jameson laugh heartily. It disappoints her
theories, she admits&mdash;finding that, albeit poets, we abstain
from burning candles at both ends at once, just as if we did
statistics and historical abstracts by nature instead. And do
not think that the trouble falls on me. Even the pouring
out of the coffee is a divided labour, and the ordering of the
dinner is quite out of my hands. As for me, when I am
so good as to let myself be carried upstairs, and so angelical
as to sit still on the sofa, and so considerate, moreover, as
<i>not</i> to put my foot into a puddle, why <i>my</i> duty is considered
done to a perfection which is worthy of all adoration; it
really is not very hard work to please this taskmaster. For
Pisa, we both like it extremely. The city is full of beauty
and repose, and the purple mountains gloriously seem to
beckon us on deeper into the vineland. We have rooms
close to the Duomo and Leaning Tower, in the great
Collegio built by Vasari, three excellent bedrooms and a
sitting-room, matted and carpeted, looking comfortable even
for England. For the last fortnight, except the very last
few sunny days, we have had rain; but the climate is as mild
as possible, no cold, with all the damp. Delightful weather
we had for the travelling. Ah, you, with your terrors of
travelling, how you amuse me! Why, the constant change
of air in the continued fine weather made me better and
better instead of worse. It did me infinite good. Mrs.
Jameson says she 'won't call me <i>improved</i>, but <i>transformed</i>
rather.' I like the new sights and the movement; my spirits
rise; I live&mdash;I can adapt myself. If you really tried it and
got as far as Paris you would be drawn on, I fancy, and on&mdash;on
to the East perhaps with H. Martineau, or at least as
near it as we are here. By the way, or out of the way, it
struck me as unfortunate that my poems should have been
printed <i>just now</i> in 'Blackwood;' I wish it had been otherwise.
Then I had a letter from one of my Leeds readers
the other day to expostulate about the <i>inappropriateness</i> of
certain of them! The fact is that I sent a heap of verses
swept from my desk and belonging to old feelings and
impressions, and not imagining that they were to be used
in that quick way. There can't be very much to like, I
fear, apart from your goodness for what calls itself mine.
Love me, dearest dear Miss Mitford, my dear kind friend&mdash;love
me, I beg of you, still and ever, only ceasing when I
cease to think of you; I will allow of that clause. Mrs.
Jameson and Gerardine are staying at the hotel here in Pisa
still, and we manage to see them every day; so good and
true and affectionate she is, and so much we shall miss her
when she goes, which will be in a day or two now. She
goes to Florence, to Siena, to Rome to complete her work
upon art, which is the object of her Italian journey. I read
your vivid and glowing description of the picture to her, or
rather I showed your picture to her, and she quite believes
with you that it is most probably a <i>Velasquez</i>. Much to be
congratulated the owner must be. I mean to know something
about pictures some day. Robert does, and I shall
get him to open my eyes for me with a little instruction.
You know that in this place are to be seen the first steps of
art, and it will be interesting to trace them from it as we go
farther ourselves. Our present residence we have taken for
six months; but we have dreams, dreams, and we discuss
them like soothsayers over the evening's roasted chestnuts
and grapes. Flush highly approves of Pisa (and the roasted
chestnuts), because here he goes out every day and speaks
Italian to the little dogs. Oh, Mr. Chorley, such a kind,
feeling note he wrote to Robert from Germany, when he
read of our marriage in 'Galignani;' we were both touched
by it. And Monckton Milnes and others&mdash;very kind all.
But in a particular manner I remember the kindness of my
valued friend Mr. Horne, who never failed me nor could fail.
Will you explain to him, or rather ask him to understand,
why I did not answer his last note? I forget even Balzac here;
tell me what he writes, and help me to love that dear,
generous Mr. Kenyon, whom I can love without help. And
let me love you, and you love me.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate and grateful<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Collegio Ferdinando [Pisa]:<br />
Saturday, November 23, 1846 [postmark].<br />

<p>We were delighted to have your note, dearest Aunt
Nina, and I answer it with my feet on your stool, so that
my feet are full of you even if my head is not, always.
Now, I shall not go a sentence farther without thanking
you for that comfort; you scarcely guessed perhaps what a
comfort it would be, that stool of yours. I am even apt to
sit on it for hours together, leaning against the sofa, till I
get to be scolded for putting myself so into the fire, and
prophesied of in respect to the probability of a 'general
conflagration' of stools and Bas; on which the prophet is
to leap from the Leaning Tower, and Flush to be left to
make the funeral oration of the establishment. In the
meantime, it really is quite a comfort that our housekeeping
should be your 'example' at Florence; we have edifying
countenances whenever we think of it. And Robert will
not by any means believe that you passed us on our own
ground, though the eleven pauls a week for breakfast, and
my humility, seemed to suggest something of the sort. I
am so glad, we are both so glad, that you are enjoying yourself
at the fullest and highest among the wonders of art,
and cannot be chilled in the soul by any of those fatal winds
you speak of. For me, I am certainly better here at Pisa,
though the penalty is to see Frate Angelico's picture with
the remembrance of you rather than the presence. Here,
indeed, we have had a little too much cold for two days;
there was a feeling of frost in the air, and a most undeniable
east wind which prevented my going out, and made me feel
less comfortable than usual at home. But, after all, one felt
ashamed to call it <i>cold</i>, and Robert found the heat on the
Arno insupportable; which set us both mourning over our
'situation' at the Collegio, where one of us could not get
out on such days without a blow on the chest from the
'wind at the corner.' Well, experience teaches, and we
shall be taught, and the cost of it is not so very much after
all. We have seen your professor once since you left us
(oh, the leaving!), or <i>spoken</i> to him once, I should say, when
he came in one evening and caught us reading, sighing,
yawning over 'Nicol&ograve; de' Lapi,' a romance by the son-in law
of Manzoni. Before we could speak, he called it 'excellent,
tr&egrave;s beau,' one of their very best romances, upon which, of
course, dear Robert could not bear to offend his literary and
national susceptibilities by a doubt even. <i>I</i>, not being so
humane, thought that any suffering reader would be justified
(under the rack-wheel) in crying out against such a book,
as the dullest, heaviest, stupidest, lengthiest. Did you ever
read it? If not, <i>don't</i>. When a father-in-law imitates
Scott, and a son-in-law imitates his father-in-law, think of
the consequences! Robert, in his zeal for Italy and against
Eug&egrave;ne Sue, tried to persuade me at first (this was before
the scene with your professor) that 'really, Ba, it wasn't so
bad,' 'really you are too hard to be pleased,' and so on; but
after two or three chapters, the dullness grew too strong for
even his benevolence, and the yawning catastrophe (supposed
to be peculiar to the 'Guida') overthrew him as completely
as it ever did me, though we both resolved to hold on by
the stirrup to the end of the two volumes. The catalogue of
the library (for observe that we subscribe now&mdash;the object is
attained!) offers a most melancholy insight into the actual
literature of Italy. Translations, translations, translations
from third and fourth and fifth rate French and English
writers, chiefly French; the roots of thought, here in Italy,
seem dead in the ground. It is well that they have great
memories&mdash;nothing else lives.</p>

<p>We have had the kindest of letters from dear noble Mr.
Kenyon; who, by the way, speaks of you as we like to hear
him. Dickens is going to Paris for the winter, and Mrs.
Butler<a name="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> (he adds) is expected in London. Dear Mr. Kenyon
calls me 'crotchety,' but Robert 'an incarnation of the
good and the true,' so that I have everything to thank him
for. There are noble people who take the world's side and
make it seem 'for the <i>nonce</i>' almost respectable; but he
gives up all the talk and fine schemes about money-making,
and allows us to wait to see whether we want it or not&mdash;the
money, I mean.</p>

<p>It is Monday, and I am only finishing this note. In the
midst came letters from my sisters, making me feel so glad
that I could not write. Everybody is well and happy, and
dear papa <i>in high spirits</i> and <i>having people to dine with him
every day</i>, so that I have not really done anyone harm in
doing myself all this good. It does not indeed bring us a
step nearer to the forgiveness, but to hear of his being in
good spirits makes me inclined to jump, with Gerardine.<a name="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a>
Dear Geddie! How pleased I am to hear of her being
happy, particularly (perhaps) as she is not too happy to
forget <i>me</i>. Is all that glory of art making her very ambitious
to work and enter into the court of the Temple?...</p>

<p>Robert's love to you both. We often talk of our prospect
of meeting you again. And for the <i>past</i>, dearest Aunt Nina,
believe of me that I feel to you more gratefully than ever I
can say, and remain, while I live,</p>

<p>Your faithful and affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Pisa: December 19, [1846].<br />

<p>Ever dearest Miss Mitford, your kindest letter is three
times welcome as usual. On the day you wrote it in the
frost, I was sitting out of doors, just in my summer mantilla,
and complaining 'of the heat this December!' But woe
comes to the discontented. Within these three or four
days we too have had frost&mdash;yes, and a little snow, for the
first time, say the Pisans, during five years. Robert says
that the mountains are powdered toward Lucca, and I, who
cannot see the mountains, can see the cathedral&mdash;the
Duomo&mdash;how it glitters whitely at the summit, between the
blue sky and its own walls of yellow marble. Of course I do
not stir an inch from the fire, yet have to struggle a little
against my old languor. Only, you see, this can't last!
it is exceptional weather, and, up to the last few days,
has been divine. And then, after all we talk of frost, my
bedroom, which has no fireplace, shows not an English
sign on the window, and the air is not <i>metallic</i> as in
England. The sun, too, is so hot that the women are
seen walking with fur capes and parasols, a curious combination.</p>

<p>I hope you had your visit from Mr. Chorley, and that
you both had the usual pleasure from it. Indeed I <i>am</i>
touched by what you tell me, and was touched by his note
to my husband, written in the first surprise; and because
Robert has the greatest regard for him, besides my own
personal reasons, I do count him in the forward rank of
our friends. You will hear that he has obliged us by
accepting a trusteeship to a settlement, forced upon me in
spite of certain professions or indispositions of mine; but
as my husband's gifts, I had no right, it appeared, by
refusing it to place him in a false position for the sake of
what dear Mr. Kenyon calls my 'crotchets.' Oh, dear
Mr. Kenyon! His kindness and goodness to us have been
past thinking of, past thanking for; we can only fall into
silence. He has thrust his hand into the fire for us by
writing to papa himself, by taking up the management of
my small money-matters when nearer hands let them drop,
by justifying us with the whole weight of his personal
influence; all this in the very face of his own habits and
susceptibilities. He has resolved that I shall not miss the
offices of father, brother, friend, nor the tenderness and
sympathy of them all. And this man is called a mere man
of the world, and would be called so rightly if the world
were a place for angels. I shall love him dearly and
gratefully to my last breath; we both shall....</p>

<p>Robert and I are deep in the fourth month of wedlock;
there has not been a shadow between us, nor a <i>word</i> (and
I have observed that all married people confess to <i>words</i>),
and that the only change I can lay my finger on in him is
simply and clearly an increase of affection. Now I need
not say it if I did not please, and I should not please, you
know, to tell a story. The truth is, that I who always did
certainly believe in love, yet was as great a sceptic as you
about the evidences thereof, and having held twenty times
that Jacob's serving fourteen years for Rachel was not too
long by fourteen days, I was not a likely person (with my
loathing dread of marriage as a loveless state, and absolute
contentment with single life as the alternative to the great
majorities of marriages), I was not likely to accept a feeling
not genuine, though from the hand of Apollo himself,
crowned with his various godships. Especially too, in my
position, I could not, would not, should not have done it.
Then, genuine feelings are genuine feelings, and do not
pass like a cloud. We are as happy as people can be, I do
believe, yet are living in a way to <i>try</i> this new relationship
of ours&mdash;in the utmost seclusion and perpetual <i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i>&mdash;no
amusement nor distraction from without, except some of
the very dullest Italian romances which throw us back on
the memory of Balzac with reiterated groans. The Italians
seem to hang on translations from the French&mdash;as we find
from the library&mdash;not merely of Balzac, but Dumas, your
Dumas, and reaching lower&mdash;long past De Kock&mdash;to the
third and fourth rate novelists. What is purely Italian is, as
far as we have read, purely dull and conventional. There
is no breath nor pulse in the Italian genius. Mrs. Jameson
writes to us from Florence that in politics and philosophy
the people are getting alive&mdash;which may be, for aught we
know to the contrary, the poetry and imagination leave
them room enough by immense vacancies.</p>

<p>Yet we delight in Italy, and dream of 'pleasures new'
for the summer&mdash;<i>pastures</i> new, I should have said&mdash;but it
comes to the same thing. The <i>padrone</i> in this house
sent us in as a gift (in gracious recognition, perhaps, of our
lawful paying of bills) an immense dish of oranges&mdash;two
hanging on a stalk with the green leaves still moist with the
morning's dew&mdash;every great orange of twelve or thirteen
with its own stalk and leaves. Such a pretty sight! And
better oranges, I beg to say, never were eaten, when we are
barbarous enough to eat them day by day after our two
o'clock dinner, softening, with the vision of them, the
winter which has just shown itself. Almost I have been as
pleased with the oranges as I was at Avignon by the
<i>pomegranate</i> given to me much in the same way. Think of
my being singled out of all our caravan of travellers&mdash;Mrs.
Jameson and Gerardine Jameson<a name="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> both there&mdash;for
that significant gift of the pomegranates! I had never seen
one before, and, of course, proceeded instantly to cut one
'deep down the middle'<a name="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>&mdash;accepting the omen. Yet, in
shame and confusion of face, I confess to not being able to
appreciate it properly. Olives and pomegranates I set on
the same shelf, to be just looked at and called by their
names, but by no means eaten bodily.</p>

<p>But you mistake me, dearest friend, about the 'Blackwood'
verses. I never thought of writing <i>applicative poems</i>&mdash;the
heavens forfend! Only that just <i>then</i>, [in] the midst of
all the talk, <i>any</i> verses of mine should come into print&mdash;and
some of them to that <i>particular effect</i>&mdash;looked unlucky.
I dare say poor papa (for instance) thought me turned
suddenly to brass itself. Well, it is perhaps more my
fancy than anything else, and was only an impression, even
there. Mr. Chorley will tell you of a play of his, which I
hope will make its way, though I do wonder how people can
bear to write for the theatres in the present state of things.
Robert is busy preparing a new edition of his collected
poems which are to be so clear that everyone who has
understood them hitherto will lose all distinction. We
both mean to be as little idle as possible.... We shall
meet one day in joy, I do hope, and then you will love my
husband for his own sake, as for mine you do not hate him
now.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
[Pisa:] December 21 [1846].<br />

<p>You must let me tell you, my dearest Mr. Boyd, that I
dreamed of you last night, and that you were looking very
well in my dream, and that you told me to break a crust
from a loaf of bread which lay by you on the table; which I
accept on recollection as a sacramental sign between us, of
peace and affection. Wasn't it strange that I should dream
so of you? Yet no; thinking awake of you, the sleeping
thoughts come naturally. Believe of me this Christmas
time, as indeed at every time, that I do not forget you, and
that all the distance and change of country can make no
difference. Understand, too (for <i>that</i> will give pleasure to
your goodness), that I am very happy, and not unwell,
though it is almost Christmas....</p>

<p>Dearest friend, are you well and in good spirits? Think
of me over the Cyprus, between the cup and the lip, though
bad things are said to fall out so. We have, instead of
Cyprus, <i>Montepulciano</i>, the famous 'King of Wine,' crowned
king, you remember, by the grace of a poet! Your Cyprus,
however, keeps supremacy over me, and will not abdicate
the divine right of being associated with you. I speak of
wine, but we live here the most secluded, quiet life possible&mdash;reading
and writing, and talking of all things in heaven and
earth, and a little besides; and sometimes even laughing as
if we had twenty people to laugh with us, or rather <i>hadn't</i>.
We know not a creature, I am happy to say, except an
Italian professor (of the university here) who called on us
the other evening and praised aloud the scholars of England.
'English Latin was best,' he said, 'and English Greek
foremost.' Do you clap your hands?</p>

<p>The new pope is more liberal than popes in general, and
people write odes to him in consequence.</p>

<p>Robert is going to bring out a new edition of his collected
poems, and you are not to read any more, if you please, till
this is done. I heard of Carlyle's saying the other day
'that he hoped more from Robert Browning, for the
people of England, than from any living English writer,'
which pleased me, of course. I am just sending off an anti-slavery
poem for America,<a name="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> too ferocious, perhaps, for the
Americans to publish: but they asked for a poem and shall
have it.</p>

<p>If I ask for a letter, shall I have it, I wonder?
Remember me and love me a little, and pray for me,
dearest friend, and believe how gratefully and ever affectionately</p>

<p>I am your</p>

<p>ELIBET,</p>

<p>Though Robert always calls me <i>Ba</i>, and thinks it the
prettiest name in the world! which is a proof, you will say,
not only of blind love but of deaf love.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<p>It was during the stay at Pisa, and early in the year
1847, that Mr. Browning first became acquainted with his
wife's 'Sonnets from the Portuguese.' Written during the
course of their courtship and engagement, they were not
shown even to him until some months after their marriage.
The story of it was told by Mr. Browning in later life to
Mr. Edmund Gosse, with leave to make it known to the
world in general; and from Mr. Gosse's publication it is
here quoted in his own words.<a name="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p>'Their custom was, Mr. Browning said, to write alone,
and not to show each other what they had written. This
was a rule which he sometimes broke through, but she
never. He had the habit of working in a downstairs room,
where their meals were spread, while Mrs. Browning studied
in a room on the floor above. One day, early in 1847, their
breakfast being over, Mrs. Browning went upstairs, while
her husband stood at the window watching the street till
the table should be cleared. He was presently aware of
some one behind him, although the servant was gone. It
was Mrs. Browning, who held him by the shoulder to prevent
his turning to look at her, and at the same time pushed
a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat. She told
him to read that, and to tear it up if he did not like it; and
then she fled again to her own room.'</p>

<p>The sonnets were intended for her husband's eye alone;
in the first instance, not even for his. No poems can ever
have been composed with less thought of the public;
perhaps for that very reason they are unmatched for simplicity
and sincerity in all Mrs. Browning's work. Her
genius in them has full mastery over its material, as it has
in few of her other poems. All impurities of style or
rhythm are purged away by the fire of love; and they stand,
not only highest among the writings of their authoress, but
also in the very forefront of English love-poems. With the
single exception of Rossetti, no modern English poet has
written of love with such genius, such beauty, and such
sincerity, as the two who gave the most beautiful example of
it in their own lives.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all those who love true poetry, Mr.
Browning judged rightly of the obligation laid upon him by
the possession of these poems. 'I dared not,' he said,
'reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language
since Shakespeare's.' Accordingly he persuaded his wife
to commit the printing of them to her friend, Miss Mitford;
and in the course of the year they appeared in a slender
volume, entitled 'Sonnets, by E.B.B.,' with the imprint
'Reading, 1847,' and marked 'Not for publication.' It was
not until three years later that they were offered to the
general public, in the volumes of 1850. Here first they
appeared under the title of 'Sonnets from the Portuguese'&mdash;a
title suggested by Mr. Browning (in preference to his
wife's proposal, 'Sonnets translated from the Bosnian') for
the sake of its half-allusion to her other poem, 'Catarina to
Camoens,' which was one of his chief favourites among her
works.</p>

<p>To these sonnets there is, however, no allusion in the
letters here published, which say little for some time of her
own work.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
February 8, 1847.<br />

<p>But, my dearest Miss Mitford, your scheme about
Leghorn is drawn out in the clouds. Now just see how
impossible. Leghorn is fifteen miles off, and though there
is a railroad there is no liberty for French books to wander
backwards and forwards without inspection and seizure.
Why, do remember that we are in Italy after all! Nevertheless,
I will tell you what we have done: transplanted our
subscription from the Italian library, which was wearing us
away into a misanthropy, or at least despair of the wits of
all Southerns, into a library which has a tolerable supply of
French books, and gives us the privilege besides of having
a French newspaper, the 'Si&egrave;cle,' left with us every evening.
Also, this library admits (is allowed to admit on certain
conditions) some books forbidden generally by the censureship,
which is of the strictest; and though Balzac appears
very imperfectly, I am delighted to find him at all, and
shall dun the bookseller for the 'Instruction criminelle,'
which I hope discharges your Lucien as a 'for&ccedil;at'&mdash;neither
man nor woman&mdash;and true poet, least of all....</p>

<p>The 'Si&egrave;cle' has for a <i>feuilleton</i> a new romance of
Souli&eacute;'s, called 'Saturnin Fichet,' which is really not good,
and tiresome to boot. Robert and I began by each of us
reading it, but after a little while he left me alone, being
certain that no good could come of such a work. So, of
course, ever since, I have been exclaiming and exclaiming
as to the wonderful improvement and increasing beauty and
glory of it, just to justify myself, and to make him sorry for
not having persevered! The truth is, however, that but for
obstinacy I should give up too. Deplorably dull the story
is, and there is a crowd of people each more indifferent than
each, to you; the pith of the plot being (very characteristically)
that the hero has somebody exactly like him. To
the reader, it's <i>all one</i> in every sense&mdash;who's who, and what's
what. Robert is a warm admirer of Balzac and has read
most of his books, but certainly&mdash;oh certainly&mdash;he does not
in a general way appreciate our French people quite with
our warmth; he takes too high a standard, I tell him, and
won't listen to a story for a story's sake. I can bear to be
amused, you know without a strong pull on my admiration.
So we have great wars sometimes, and I put up Dumas'
flag, or Souli&eacute;'s, or Eug&egrave;ne Sue's (yet he was properly
possessed by the 'Myst&egrave;res de Paris') and carry it till my
arms ache. The plays and vaudevilles he knows far more
of than I do, and always maintains they are the happiest
growth of the French school&mdash;setting aside the <i>masters</i>,
observe&mdash;for Balzac and George Sand hold all their honours;
and, before your letter came, he had told me about the
'Kean' and the other dramas. Then we read together the
other day the 'Rouge et Noir,' that powerful book of
Stendhal's (Beyle), and he thought it very striking, and
observed&mdash;what I had thought from the first and again and
again&mdash;that it was exactly like Balzac <i>in the raw</i>, in the
material and undeveloped conception. What a book it is
really, and so full of pain and bitterness, and the gall of
iniquity! The new Dumas I shall see in time, perhaps,
and it is curious that Robert had just been telling me the
very story you speak of in your letter, from the 'Causes
C&eacute;l&egrave;bres.' I never read it&mdash;the more shame! Dearest
friend, all this talk of French books and no talk about <i>you</i>&mdash;the
<i>most</i> shame! You don't tell me enough of yourself,
and I want to hear, because (besides the usual course of
reasons) Mr. Chorley spoke of you as if you were not as
cheerful as usual; do tell me. Ah! if you fancy that I
do not love you as near, through being so far, you are unjust
to me as you never were before. For myself, the brightness
round me has had a cloud on it lately by an illness of poor
Wilson's.... She would not go to Dr. Cook till I was
terrified one night, while she was undressing me, by her
sinking down on the sofa in a shivering fit. Oh, so
frightened I was, and Robert ran out for a physician; and
I could have shivered too, with the fright. But she is
convalescent now, thank God! and in the meanwhile I have
acquired a heap of practical philosophy, and have learnt
how it is possible (in certain conditions of the human
frame) to comb out and twist up one's own hair, and lace
one's very own stays, and cause hooks and eyes to meet
behind one's very own back, besides making toast and water
for Wilson&mdash;which last miracle, it is only just to say, was
considerably assisted by Robert's counsels 'not quite to set
fire to the bread' while one was toasting it. He was the
best and kindest all that time, as even <i>he</i> could be, and
carried the kettle when it was too heavy for me, and helped
me with heart and head. Mr. Chorley could not have
praised him too much, be very sure. I, who always
rather appreciated him, do set down the thoughts I had
as merely unjust things; he exceeds them all, indeed. Yes,
Mr. Chorley has been very kind to us. I had a kind note
myself from him a few days since, and do you know that
we have a sort of hope of seeing him in Italy this year, with
dearest Mr. Kenyon, who has the goodness to crown his
goodness by a 'dream' of coming to see us? We leave
Pisa in April (did I tell you that?) and pass through Florence
towards the north of Italy&mdash;to <i>Venice</i>, for instance. In the
way of writing, I have not done much yet&mdash;just finished my
rough sketch of an anti-slavery ballad and sent it off to
America, where nobody will print it, I am certain, because
I could not help making it bitter. If they <i>do</i> print it, I
shall thank them more boldly in earnest than I fancy now.
Tell me of Mary Howitt's new collection of ballads&mdash;are
they good? I warmly wish that Mr. Chorley may succeed
with his play; but how can Miss Cushman promise a
hundred nights for an untried work?... Perhaps you may
find the two last numbers of the 'Bells and Pomegranates'
less obscure&mdash;it seems so to me. Flush has grown an absolute
monarch and barks one distracted when he wants a door
opened. Robert spoils him, I think. Do think of me as
your ever affectionate and grateful</p>

<p>BA.</p>

<p>Have you seen 'Agnes de Misanie,' the new play by
the author of 'Lucretia'? A witty feuilletoniste says of it
that, besides all the unities of Aristotle, it comprises, from beginning
to end, <i>unity of situation</i>. Not bad, is it? Madame
Ancelot has just succeeded with a comedy, called 'Une
Ann&eacute;e &agrave; Paris.' By the way, <i>shall you go to Paris this spring</i>?<a name="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<br /><br />
<p>From Mr. Browning's family, though she had as yet had no
opportunity of making acquaintance with them face to face,
Mrs. Browning from the first met with an affectionate
reception. The following is the first now extant of a series
of letters written by her to Miss Browning, the poet's
sister. The abrupt and private nature of the marriage
never seems to have caused the slightest coldness of feeling
in this quarter, though it must have caused anxiety; and the
tone of the early letters, in which so new and unfamiliar a
relation had to be taken up, does equal honour to the
writer and to the recipient.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
[Pisa: about February 1847.]<br />

<p>I must begin by thanking dearest Sarianna again for her
note, and by assuring her that the affectionate tone of it
quite made me happy and grateful together&mdash;that I am grateful
to <i>all of you</i>: do <i>feel</i> that I am. For the rest, when
I see (afar off) Robert's minute manuscripts, a certain distrust
steals over me of anything I can possibly tell you of
our way of living, lest it should be the vainest of repetitions,
and by no means worth repeating, both at once. Such a
quiet silent life it is&mdash;going to hear the Friar preach in the
Duomo, a grand event in it, and the wind laying flat all our
schemes about Volterra and Lucca! I have had to give up
even the Friar for these three days past; there is nothing for
me when I have driven out Robert to take his necessary walk
but to sit and watch the pinewood blaze. He is grieved
about the illness of his cousin, only I do hope that your next
letter will confirm the happy change which stops the further
anxiety, and come soon for that purpose, besides others.
Your letters never can come too often, remember, even when
they have not to speak of illness, and I for my part must
always have a thankful interest in your cousin for the kind
part he took in the happiest event of my life. You have to
tell us too of your dear mother&mdash;Robert is so anxious about
her always. How deeply and tenderly he loves her and all
of you, never could have been more manifest than now when
he is away from you and has to talk <i>of</i> you instead of
<i>to</i> you. By the way (or rather out of the way) I quite
took your view of the purposed ingratitude to poor Miss
Haworth<a name="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a>&mdash;it would have been worse in him than the sins of
'Examiner' and 'Athenaeum.' If authors won't feel for one another,
there's an end of the world of writing! Oh, I think he proposed
it in a moment of hardheartedness&mdash;we all put on tortoiseshell
now and then, and presently come out into the sun as
sensitively as ever. Besides Miss Haworth has written to us
very kindly; and kindness doesn't spring up everywhere,
like the violets in your gravel walks. See how I understand

me be your affectionate sister,</p>

<p>The correspondence with Mr. Westwood, which had
lapsed for a considerable time, was resumed with the
following letter:</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
Collegio Ferdinando, Pisa: March 10, 1847.<br />

<p>If really, my dear Mr. Westwood, it was an 'ill temper'
in you, causing the brief note, it was a most flattering ill
temper, and I thank you just as I have had reason to do
for the good nature which has caused you to bear with me
so often and so long. You have been misled on some
points. I did not go to Italy last year, or rather the year
before last! I was disappointed and forced to stay in
Wimpole Street after all; but the winter being so mild, so
miraculously mild for England you may remember, I was
spared my winter relapse and left liberty for new plans such
as I never used to think were in my destiny! Such a change
it is to me, such a strange happiness and freedom, and you
must not in your kindness wish me back again, but rather
be contented, like a friend as you are, to hear that I am
very happy and very well, and still doubtful whether all the
brightness can be meant for <i>me</i>! It is just as if the sun
rose again at 7 o'clock P.M. The strangeness seems so
great....</p>

<p>I am now very well, and so happy as not to think much
of it, except for the sake of another. And do you fancy
how I feel, carried; into the visions of nature from my
gloomy room. Even now I walk as in a dream. We
made a pilgrimage from Avignon to Vaucluse in right
poetical duty, and I and my husband sate upon two stones
in the midst of the fountain which in its dark prison of
rocks flashes and roars and testifies to the memory of
Petrarch. It was louder and fuller than usual when we
were there, on account of the rains; and Flush, though by
no means born to be a hero, considered my position so
outrageous that he dashed through the water to me,
splashing me all over, so he is baptised in Petrarch's name.
The scenery is full of grandeur, the rocks sheathe themselves
into the sky, and nothing grows there except a little cypress
here and there, and a straggling olive tree; and the fountain
works out its soul in its stony prison, and runs away in a
green rapid stream. Such a striking sight it is. I sate
upon deck, too, in our passage from Marseilles to Genoa,
and had a vision of mountains, six or seven deep, one
behind another. As to Pisa, call it a beautiful town, you
cannot do less with Arno and its palaces, and above all the
wonderful Duomo and Campo Santo, and Leaning Tower
and Baptistery, all of which are a stone's throw from our
windows. We have rooms in a great college-house built
by Vasari, and fallen into desuetude from collegiate
purposes; and here we live the quietest and most <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
of lives, knowing nobody, hearing nothing, and for nearly
three months together never catching a glimpse of a paper.
Oh, how wrong you were about the 'Times'! Now, however,
we subscribe to a French and Italian library, and have
a French newspaper every evening, the 'Si&egrave;cle,' and so look
through a loophole at the world. Yet, not too proud are
we, even now, for all the news you will please to send us in
charity: 'da obolum Belisario!'</p>

<p>What do you mean about poor Tennyson? I heard of
him last on his return from a visit to the Swiss mountains,
which 'disappointed him,' he was <i>said to say</i>. Very wrong,
either of mountains or poet!</p>

<p>Tell me if you make acquaintance with Mrs. Hewitt's
new ballads.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson is engaged in a work on art which will be
very interesting....</p>

<p>Flush's love to your Flopsy. Flush has grown very
overbearing in this Italy, I think because my husband
spoils him (if not for the glory at Vaucluse); Robert
declares that the said Flush considers him, my husband, to
be created for the especial purpose of doing him service, and
really it looks rather like it.</p>

<p>Never do I see the 'Athenaeum' now, but before I left
England some pure gushes between the rocks reminded
me of you. Tell me all you can; it will all be like rain
upon dry ground. My husband bids me offer his regards
to you&mdash;if you will accept them; and that you may do it
ask your heart. I will assure you (aside) that his poetry is as
the prose of his nature: he himself is so much better and
higher than his own works.</p>

<p>In the middle of April the Brownings left Pisa and
journeyed to Florence, arriving there on April 20. There,
however, the programme was arrested, and, save for an
abortive excursion to Vallombrosa, whence they were
repulsed by the misogynist principles of the monks, they
continued to reside in Florence for the remainder of the
year. Their first abode was in the Via delle Belle Donne;
but after the return from Vallombrosa, in August, they
moved across the river, and took furnished rooms in the
Palazzo Guidi, the building which, under the name of
'Casa Guidi,' is for ever associated with their memory.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: April 24, 1847.<br />

<p>I received your letter, my dearest friend, by this day's
post, and wrote a little note directly to the office as a trap
for the feet of your travellers. If they escape us after all,
therefore, they may praise their stars for it rather than my
intentions&mdash;<i>our</i> intentions, I should say, for Robert will
gladly do everything he can in the way of expounding a
text or two of the glories of Florence, and we both shall be
much pleased and cordially pleased to learn more of Fanny
and her brother than the glance at Pisa could teach us. As
for me, she will let me have a little talking for my share: I
can't walk about or see anything. I lie here flat on the sofa
in order to be wise; I rest and take port wine by wineglasses;
and a few more days of it will prepare me, I hope
and trust, for an interview with the Venus de' Medici.
Think of my having been in Florence since Tuesday, this
being Saturday, and not a step taken into the galleries. It
seems a disgrace, a sort of involuntary disgraceful act, or
rather no-act, which to complain of relieves one to some
degree. And how kind of you to wish to hear from me of
myself! There is nothing really much the matter with me;
I am just <i>weak</i>, sleeping and eating dreadfully well considering
that Florence isn't seen yet, and 'looking well,' too,
says Mrs. Jameson, who, with her niece, is our guest just
now. It would have been wise if I had rested longer at
Pisa, but, you see, there was a long engagement to meet
Mrs. Jameson here, and she expressed a very kind
unwillingness to leave Italy without keeping it: also she had
resolved to come out of her way on purpose for this, and, as
I had the consent of my physician, we determined to perform
our part of the compact; and in order to prepare for
the longer journey I went out in the carriage a little too
soon, perhaps, and a little too long. At least, if I had kept
quite still I should have been strong by this time&mdash;not that
I have done myself harm in the serious sense, observe&mdash;and
now the affair is accomplished, I shall be wonderfully discreet
and self-denying, and resist Venuses and Apollos like
some one wiser than the gods themselves. My chest is very
well; there has been no symptom of evil in that quarter....
We took the whole coup&eacute; of the diligence&mdash;but regretted
our first plan of the <i>vettura</i> nevertheless&mdash;and now are
settled in very comfortable rooms in the 'Via delle Belle
Donne' just out of the Piazza Santa Maria Novella, very
superior rooms to our apartment in Pisa, in which we were
cheated to the uttermost with all the subtlety of Italy and
to the full extent of our ignorance; think what <i>that</i> must
have been! Our present apartment, with the hire of a grand
piano and music, does not cost us so much within ever so
many francisconi. Oh, and you don't frighten me though
we are on the north side of the Arno! We have taken our
rooms for two months, and may be here longer, and the
fear of the heat was stronger with me than the fear of the cold,
or we might have been in the Pitti and 'arrostiti' by this time.
We expected dear Mrs. Jameson on Saturday, but she came
on Friday evening, having suddenly remembered that it was
Shakespeare's birthday, and bringing with her from Arezzo
a bottle of wine to 'drink to his memory with two other
poets,' so there was a great deal of merriment, as you may
fancy, and Robert played Shakespeare's favorite air, 'The
Light of Love,' and everybody was delighted to meet
everybody, and Roman news and Pisan dullness were
properly discussed on every side. She saw a good deal of
Cobden in Rome, and went with him to the Sistine Chapel.
He has no feeling for art, and, being very true and earnest,
could only do his best to <i>try</i> to admire Michael Angelo;
but here and there, where he understood, the pleasure was
expressed with a blunt characteristic simplicity. Standing
before the statue of Demosthenes, he said: 'That man is
persuaded himself of what he speaks, and will therefore
persuade others.' She liked him exceedingly. For my part,
I should join in more admiration if it were not for his having
<i>accepted money</i>, but paid patriots are no heroes of mine.
'Verily they have their reward.' O'Connell had arrived in
Rome, and it was considered that he came only to die.
Among the artists, Gibson and Wyatt were doing great
things; she wishes us to know Gibson particularly. As to
the Pope he lives in an atmosphere of love and admiration,
and 'he is doing <i>what he can</i>,' Mrs. Jameson believes.
Robert says: 'A dreadful situation, after all, for a man of
understanding and honesty! I pity him from my soul, for
he can, at best, only temporise with truth.' But human
nature is doomed to pay a high price for its opportunities.
Delighted I am to have your good account of dear Mr.
Martin, though you are naughty people to persist in going
to England so soon. Do write to me and tell me all about
both of you. I will do what I can&mdash;like the Pope&mdash;but
what can I do? Yes, indeed, I mean to enjoy art and
nature too; one shall not exclude the other. This
Florence seems divine as we pass the bridges, and my
husband, who knows everything, is to teach and show me
all the great wonders, so that I am reasonably impatient
to try my advantages. His kind regards to you both, and
my best love, dearest friends....</p>

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Florence: May 12, [1847].<br />

<p>I was afraid, we both were afraid for you, dearest
friend, when we saw the clouds gather and heard the rain
fall as it did that day at Florence. It seemed impossible
that you should be beyond the evil influence, should you
have travelled ever so fast; but, after all, a storm in the
Apennines, like many a moral storm, will be better perhaps
than a calm to look back upon. We talked of you and
thought of you, and missed you at coffee time, and
regretted that so pleasant a week (for us) should have gone
so fast, as fast as a dull week, or, rather, a good deal faster.
Dearest friend, do believe that we <i>felt</i> your goodness in
Coming to us&mdash;in making us an object&mdash;before you left
Italy; it fills up the measure of goodness and kindness for
which we shall thank and love you all our lives. Never
fancy that we can forget you or be less touched by the
memory of what you have been to us in affection and
sympathy&mdash;never. And don't <i>you</i> lose sight of <i>us</i>; do
write often, and do, <i>do</i> make haste and come back to Italy,
and then make use of us in any and every possible way as
house-takers or house-mates, for we are ready to accept the
lowest place or the highest. The week you gave us would
be altogether bright and glad if it had not been for the
depression and anxiety on your part. May God turn it
all to gain and satisfaction in some unlooked-for way. To
be a <i>road-maker</i> is weary work, even across the Apennines
of life. We have not science enough for it if we have
strength, which we haven't either. Do you remember how
Sindbad shut his eyes and let himself be carried over the
hills by an eagle? <i>That</i> was better than to set about
breaking stones. Also what you could do you have done;
you have finished your part, and the sense of a fulfilled
duty is in itself satisfying&mdash;is and must be. My sympathies
go with you entirely, while I wish your dear Gerardine to
be happy; I wish it from my heart.... Just after you
left us arrived our box with the precious deeds, which are
thrown into the cabinet for want of witnesses. And then
Robert has had a letter from Mr. Forster with the date of
<i>Shakespeare's birthday</i>, and overflowing with kindness really
both to himself and me. It quite touched me, that letter.
Also we have had a visitation from an American, but on the
point of leaving Florence and very tame and inoffensive, and
we bore it very well considering. He sent us a new literary
periodical of the old world, in which, among other interesting
matter, I had the pleasure of reading an account of my
own 'blindness,' taken from a French paper (the 'Presse'),
and mentioned with humane regret. Well! and what more
news is there to tell you? I have been out once, only
once, and only for an inglorious glorious drive round the
Piazza Gran Duca, past the Duomo, outside the walls, and
in again at the Cascine. It was like the trail of a vision in
the evening sun. I saw the Perseus in a sort of flash.
The Duomo is more after the likeness of a Duomo than
Pisa can show; I like those masses in ecclesiastical
architecture. Now we are plotting how to, engage a
carriage for a month's service without ruining ourselves, for
we <i>must</i> see, and I <i>can't</i> walk and see, though much
stronger than when we parted, and looking much better, as
Robert and the looking glass both do testify. I have
seemed at last 'to leap to a conclusion' of convalescence.
But the heat&mdash;oh, so hot it is. If it is half as hot with you,
you must be calling on the name of St. Lawrence by this
time, and require no 'turning.' I should not like to travel
under such a sun. It would be too like playing at snapdragon.
Yes, 'brightly happy.' Women generally <i>lose</i> by
marriage, but I have gained the world by mine. If it were
not for some griefs, which are and must be griefs, I should
be too happy perhaps, which is good for nobody. May
God bless you, my dear, dearest friend! Robert must be
content with sending his love to-day, and shall write
another day. We both love you every day. My love and
a kiss to dearest Gerardine, who is to remember to write
to me.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<i>To H.S. Boyd</i><br />
Florence: May 26, 1847.<br />

<p>I should have answered your letter, my dearest friend,
more quickly, but when it came I was ill, as you may have
heard, and afterwards I wished to wait until I could send
you information about the Leaning Tower and the bells<a name="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>.
The book you required, about the cathedral, Robert has
tried in vain to procure for you. Plenty of such books,
but <i>not in English</i>. In London such things are to be
found, I should think, without difficulty, for instance,
'Murray's Handbook to Northern Italy,' though rather
dear (12<i>s.</i>), would give you sufficiently full information
upon the ecclesiastical glories both of Pisa and of this
beautiful Florence, from whence I write to you.... I
will answer for the harmony of the bells, as we lived within
a stone's throw of them, and they began at four o'clock
every morning and rang my dreams apart. The Pasquareccia
(the fourth) especially has a profound note in it,
which may well have thrilled horror to the criminal's heart.<a name="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
It was ghastly in its effects; dropped into the deep of
night like a thought of death. Often have I said, 'Oh,
how ghastly!' and then turned on my pillow and dreamed a
bad dream. But if the bell founders at Pisa have a merited
reputation, let no one say as much for the bellringers.
The manner in which all the bells of all the churches in
the city are shaken together sometimes would certainly
make you groan in despair of your ears. The discord is
fortunately indescribable. Well&mdash;but here we are at
Florence, the most beautiful of the cities devised by
man....</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I have seen the Venus, I have seen
the divine Raphaels. I have stood by Michael Angelo's
tomb in Santa Croce. I have looked at the wonderful
Duomo. This cathedral! After all, the elaborate grace of
the Pisan cathedral is one thing, and the massive grandeur
of this of Florence is another and better thing; it struck
me with a sense of the sublime in architecture. At Pisa
we say, 'How beautiful!' here we say nothing; it is enough
if we can breathe. The mountainous marble masses overcome
as we look up&mdash;we feel the weight of them on the
soul. Tesselated marbles (the green treading its elaborate
pattern into the dim yellow, which seems the general hue of
the structure) climb against the sky, self-crowned with that
prodigy of marble domes. It struck me as a wonder in
architecture. I had neither seen nor imagined the like of
it in any way. It seemed to carry its theology out with it;
it signified more than a mere building. Tell me everything
you want to know. I shall like to answer a thousand
questions. Florence is beautiful, as I have said before, and
must say again and again, most beautiful. The river rushes
through the midst of its palaces like a crystal arrow, and it
is hard to tell, when you see all by the clear sunset,
whether those churches, and houses, and windows, and
bridges, and people walking, in the water or out of the
water, are the real walls, and windows, and bridges, and
people, and churches. The only difference is that, down
below, there is a double movement; the movement of the
stream besides the movement of life. For the rest, the
distinctness of the eye is as great in one as in the
other.... Remember me to such of my friends as
remember me kindly when unreminded by me. I am very
happy&mdash;happier and happier.</p>

<p>ELIBET.</p>

<p>Robert's best regards to you always.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Palazzo Guidi, Via Maggio, Florence:<br />
August 7, 1847 [postmark].<br />

<p>You will be surprised perhaps, and perhaps not, dearest
friend, to find that we are still at Florence. Florence 'holds
us with a glittering eye;' there's a charm cast round us, and
we can't get away. In the first place, your news of Recoaro
came so late that, as you said yourself, we ought to have
been there before your letter reached us. Nobody would
encourage us to go north on any grounds, indeed, and if
anybody speaks a word now in favour of Venice, straight
comes somebody else speaking the direct contrary. Altogether,
we took to making a plan of our own&mdash;a great, wild,
delightful plan of plunging into the mountains and spending
two or three months at the monastery of Vallombrosa,
until the heat was passed, and dear Mr. Kenyon decided,
and we could either settle for the winter at Florence or
pass on to Rome. Could anything look more delightful than
that? Well, we got a letter of recommendation to the abbot,
and left our apartment, Via delle Belle Donne, a week
before our three months were done, thoroughly burned
out by the sun; set out at four in the morning, reached
Pelago, and from thence travelled five miles along a 'via
non rotabile' through the most romantic scenery. Oh,
such mountains!&mdash;as if the whole world were alive with
mountains&mdash;such ravines&mdash;black in spite of flashing waters
in them&mdash;such woods and rocks&mdash;travelled in basket
sledges drawn by four white oxen&mdash;Wilson and I and the
luggage&mdash;and Robert riding step by step. We were four
hours doing the five miles, so you may fancy what rough
work it was. Whether I was most tired or charmed was a
<i>tug</i> between body and soul. The worst was that, there
being a new abbot at the monastery&mdash;an austere man
jealous of his sanctity and the approach of women&mdash;our
letter, and Robert's eloquence to boot, did nothing for us,
and we were ingloriously and ignominiously expelled at the
end of five days. For three days we were welcome; for two
more we kept our ground; but after <i>that</i>, out we were
thrust, with baggage and expectations. Nothing could be
much more provoking. And yet we came back very
merrily for disappointed people to Florence, getting up at
three in the morning, and rolling or sliding (as it might
happen) down the precipitous path, and seeing round us a
morning glory of mountains, clouds, and rising sun, such as
we never can forget&mdash;back to Florence and our old lodgings,
and an eatable breakfast of coffee and bread, and a confession
one to another that if we had won the day instead
of losing it, and spent our summer with the monks, we
should have grown considerably <i>thinner</i> by the victory.
They make their bread, I rather imagine, with the sawdust
of their fir trees, and, except oil and wine&mdash;yes, and plenty
of beef (of <i>fleisch</i>, as your Germans say, of all kinds,
indeed), which isn't precisely the fare to suit us&mdash;we were
thrown for nourishment on the great sights around. Oh,
but so beautiful were mountains and forests and waterfalls
that I could have kept my ground happily for the two
months&mdash;even though the only book I saw there was the
chronicle of their San Gualberto. Is he not among your
saints? Being routed fairly, and having breakfasted fully
at our old apartment, Robert went out to find cool rooms, if
possible, and make the best of our position, and now we are
settled magnificently in this Palazzo Guidi on a first floor
in an apartment which <i>looks</i> quite beyond our means, and
<i>would be</i> except in the dead part of the season&mdash;a suite of
spacious rooms opening on a little terrace and furnished
elegantly&mdash;rather to suit our predecessor the Russian prince
than ourselves&mdash;but cool and in a delightful situation, six
paces from the Piazza Pitti, and with right of daily
admission to the Boboli gardens. We pay what we paid
in the Via Belle Donne. Isn't this prosperous? You
would be surprised to see <i>me</i>, I think, I am so very well
(and look so)&mdash;dispensed from being carried upstairs, and
inclined to take a run, for a walk, every now and then. I
scarcely recognise myself or my ways, or my own spirits, all
is so different....</p>

<p>We have made the acquaintance of Mr. Powers,<a name="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> who is
delightful&mdash;of a most charming simplicity, with those great
burning eyes of his. Tell me what you think of his boy
listening to the shell. Oh, your Raphaels! how divine!
And M. Angelo's sculptures! His pictures I leap up to
in vain, and fall back regularly. Write of your book and
yourself, and write soon; and let me be, as always, your
affectionate BA.</p>

<p>We are here for two months certain, and perhaps longer.
Do write.</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Nina,&mdash;Ba has said something for me, I
hope. In any case, my love goes with hers, I trust you
are well and happy, as we are, and as we would make you
if we could. Love to Geddie. Ever yours, [R.B.]</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: August 7, 1847.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;How I have been longing to
get this letter, which comes at last, and justifies the longing
by the pleasure it gives!... How kind, how affectionate
you are to me, and how strong your claim is that I should
thrust on you, in defiance of good taste and conventions,
every evidence and assurance of my happiness, so as to
justify your <i>faith</i> to yourselves and others. Indeed, indeed,
dearest Mrs. Martin, you may 'exult' for me&mdash;and this
though it should all end here and now. The uncertainties
of life and death seem nothing to me. A year (nearly) is
saved from the darkness, and if that one year has compensated
for those that preceded it&mdash;which it has, abundantly&mdash;why,
let it for those that shall follow, if it so please God.
Come what may, I feel as if I never could have a right to
murmur. I have been happy enough. Brought about too
it was, indeed, by a sort of miracle which to this moment,
when I look back, bewilders me to think of; and if you
knew the details, counted the little steps, and could;
compare my moral position three years and a half ago with
<i>this</i>, you would come to despise San Gualberto's miraculous
tree at Vallombrosa, which, being dead, gave out green leaves
in recognition of his approach, as testified by the inscription&mdash;do
you remember? But you can't stop to-day to read mine,
so rather I shall tell you of our exploit in the mountains.
Only one thing I must say first, one thing which you must
forgive me for the vanity of resolving to say at last, having had
it in my head very often. There's a detestable engraving,
which, if you have the ill luck to see (and you <i>may</i>, because,
horrible to relate, it is in the shop windows), will you have the
kindness, for my sake, not to fancy <i>like Robert</i>?&mdash;it being, as
he says himself, the very image of '<i>a young man at Waterloo
House</i>, in a moment of inspiration&mdash;&quot;A lovely blue,
ma'am.&quot;' It is as like Robert as Flush. And now I am
going to tell you of Vallombrosa. You heard how we
meant to stay two months there, and you are to imagine
how we got up at three in the morning to escape the heat
(imagine me!)&mdash;and with all our possessions and a 'dozen
of port' (which my husband doses me with twice a day
because once it was necessary) proceeded to Pelago by
vettura, and from thence in two sledges, drawn each by
two white bullocks up to the top of the holy mountain.
(Robert was on horseback.) Precisely it must be as you
left it. Who can make a road up a house? We were four
hours going five miles, and I with all my goodwill was
dreadfully tired, and scarcely in appetite for the beef and
oil with which we were entertained at the House of
Strangers. We are simple people about diet, and had said
over and over that we would live on eggs and milk and
bread and butter during these two months. We might
as well have said that we would live on manna from
heaven. The things we had fixed on were just the impossible
things. Oh, that bread, with the fetid smell, which stuck
in the throat like Macbeth's amen! I am not surprised,
you recollect it! The hens had 'got them to a nunnery,'
and objected to lay eggs, and the milk and the holy water
stood confounded. But of course we spread the tablecloth,
just as you did, over all drawbacks of the sort; and
the beef and oil, as I said, and the wine too, were liberal
and excellent, and we made our gratitude apparent in
Robert's best Tuscan&mdash;in spite of which we were turned
out ignominiously at the end of five days, having been
permitted to overstay the usual three days by only two. No,
nothing could move the lord abbot. He is a new abbot, and;
given to sanctity, and has set his face against women.
'While he is abbot,' he said to our mediating monk, 'he
<i>will</i> be abbot. So he is abbot, and we had to come back to
Florence.' As I read in the 'Life of San Gualberto,' laid
on the table for the edification of strangers, the brothers
attain to sanctification, among other means, by cleaning
out pigsties with their bare hands, without spade or shovel;
but <i>that</i> is uncleanliness enough&mdash;they wouldn't touch the
little finger of a woman. Angry I was, I do assure you.
I should have liked to stay there, in spite of the bread.
We should have been only a little thinner at the end. And
the scenery&mdash;oh, how magnificent! How we enjoyed that
great, silent, ink-black pine wood! And do you remember
the sea of mountains to the left? How grand it is! We
were up at three in the morning again to return to Florence,
and the glory of that morning sun breaking the clouds to
pieces among the hills is something ineffaceable from my
remembrance. We came back ignominiously to our old
rooms, but found it impossible to stay on account of the
suffocating heat, yet we scarcely could go far from Florence,
because of Mr. Kenyon and our hope of seeing him here
(since lost). A perplexity ended by Robert's discovery of
our present apartments, on the Pitti side of the river (indeed,
close to the Grand Duke's palace), consisting of a suite of
spacious and delightful rooms, which come within our
means only from the deadness of the summer season, comparatively
quite cool, and with a terrace which I enjoy to
the uttermost through being able to walk there without a
bonnet, by just stepping out of the window. The church of
San Felice is opposite, so we haven't a neighbour to look
through the sunlight or moonlight and take observations.
Isn't that pleasant altogether? We ordered back the piano
and the book subscription, and settled for two months, and
forgave the Vallombrosa monks for the wrong they did us,
like secular Christians. What is to come after, I can't tell
you. But probably we shall creep slowly along toward
Rome, and spend some hot time of it at Perugia, which is
said to be cool enough. I think more of other things,
wishing that my dearest, kindest sisters had a present as
bright as mine&mdash;to think nothing at all of the future.
Dearest Henrietta's position has long made me uneasy,
and, since she frees me into confidence by her confidence to
you, I will tell you so. Most undesirable it is that this
should be continued, and yet where is there a door open
to escape?<a name="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> ... My dear brothers have the illusion that
nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year.
Good heavens! how preposterous it does seem to me!
<i>We</i> scarcely spend three hundred, and I have every luxury,
I ever had, and which it would be so easy to give up, at
need; and Robert wouldn't sleep, I think, if an unpaid
bill dragged itself by any chance into another week. He
says that when people get into 'pecuniary difficulties,' his
'sympathies always go with the butchers and bakers.' So
we keep out of scrapes yet, you see....</p>

<p>Your grateful and most affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>We have had the most delightful letter from Carlyle,
who has the goodness to say that not for years has a
marriage occurred in his private circle in which he so
heartily rejoiced as in ours. He is a personal friend of
Robert's, so that I have reason to be very proud and glad.</p>

<p>Robert's best regards to you both always, and he is no
believer in magnetism (only <i>I</i> am). Do mention Mr. C.
Hanford's health. How strange that he should come to
witness my marriage settlement! Did you hear?</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: August 20, [1847],<br />

<p>I have received your letter at last, my ever dearest Miss
Mitford, not the missing letter, but the one which comes to
make up for it and to catch up my thoughts, which were
grumbling at high tide, I do assure you.... As you
observed last year (not without reason), these are the days
of marrying and giving in marriage. Mr. Horne<a name="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>, you
see ... With all my heart I hope he may be very happy.
Men risk a good deal in marriage, though not as much as
women do; and on the other hand, the singleness of a man
when his youth is over is a sadder thing than the saddest
which an unmarried woman can suffer. Nearly all my
friends of both sexes have been draining off into marriage
these two years, scarcely one will be left in the sieve, and I
may end by saying that I have happiness enough for my
own share to be divided among them all and leave everyone,
contented. For me, I take it for pure magic, this life of
mine. Surely nobody was ever so happy before. I shall
wake some morning with my hair all dripping out of the
enchanted bucket, or if not we shall both claim the 'Flitch'
next September, if you can find one for us in the land of
Cockaigne, drying in expectancy of the revolution in
Tennyson's 'Commonwealth.' Well, I don't agree with
Mr. Harness in admiring the lady of 'Locksley Hall.' I
<i>must</i> either pity or despise a woman who could have married
Tennyson and chose a common man. If happy in her
choice, I despise her. That's matter of opinion, of course.
You may call it matter of foolishness when I add that I
personally would rather be teased a little and smoked over a
good deal by a man whom I could look up to and be proud of,
than have my feet kissed all day by a Mr. Smith in boots and
a waistcoat, and thereby chiefly distinguished. Neither I nor
another, perhaps, had quite a right to expect a combination
of qualities, such as meet, though, in my husband, who is as
faultless and pure in his private life as any Mr. Smith of
them all, who would not owe five shillings, who lives like a
woman in abstemiousness on a pennyworth of wine a day,
never touches a cigar even.... Do you hear, as we do,
from Mr. Forster, that his<a name="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> new poem is his best work? As
soon as you read it, let me have your opinion. The subject
seems almost identical with one of Chaucer's. Is it not so?
We have spent here the most delightful of summers,
notwithstanding the heat, and I begin to comprehend the
possibility of St. Lawrence's ecstasies on the gridiron.
Very hot it certainly has been and is, yet there have been
cool intermissions; and as we have spacious and airy rooms,
and as Robert lets me sit all day in my white dressing gown
without a single masculine criticism, and as we can step out
of the window on a sort of balcony terrace which is quite
private and swims over with moonlight in the evenings, and
as we live upon water melons and iced water and figs and
all manner of fruit, we bear the heat with an angelic patience
and felicity which really are edifying. We tried to make the
monks of Vallombrosa let us stay with them for two months,
but their new abbot said or implied that Wilson and I stank in
his nostrils, being women, and San Gualberto, the establishes
of their order, had enjoined on them only the mortification
of cleaning out pigsties without fork or shovel. So here a
couple of women besides was (as Dickens's American said)
'a piling it up rayther too mountainious.' So we were sent
away at the end of five days. So provoking! Such scenery,
such hills, such a sea of hills looking alive among the clouds.
<i>Which</i> rolled, it was difficult to discern. Such pine woods,
supernaturally silent, with the ground black as ink, such
chestnut and beech forests hanging from the mountains,
such rocks and torrents, such chasms and ravines. There
were eagles there, too, [and] there was <i>no road</i>. Robert
went on horseback, and Flush, Wilson, and I were drawn
in a sledge (i.e. an old hamper, a basket wine hamper
without a wheel) by two white bullocks up the precipitous
mountains. Think of my travelling in that fashion in those
wild places at four o'clock in the morning, a little frightened,
dreadfully tired, but in an ecstasy of admiration above all!
It was a sight to see before one died and went away to
another world. Well, but being expelled ignominiously at
the end of five days, we had to come back to Florence, and
find a new apartment cooler than the old, and wait for dear
Mr. Kenyon. And dear Mr. Kenyon does not come (not this
autumn, but he may perhaps at the first dawn of spring), and
on September 20 we take up our knapsacks and turn our
faces towards Rome, I think, creeping slowly along, with a
pause at Arezzo, and a longer pause at Perugia, and another
perhaps at Terni. Then we plan to take an apartment we
have heard of, over the Tarpeian Rock, and enjoy Rome as
we have enjoyed Florence. More can scarcely be. This
Florence is unspeakably beautiful, by grace both of nature and
art, and the wheels of life slide on upon the grass (according
to continental ways) with little trouble and less expense.
Dinner, 'unordered,' comes through the streets and spreads
itself on our table, as hot as if we had smelt cutlets hours
before. The science of material life is understood here and
in France. Now tell me, what right has England to be the
dearest country in the world? But I love dearly dear
England, and we hope to spend many a green summer in
her yet. The winters you will excuse us, will you not?
People who are, like us, neither rich nor strong, claim
such excuses. I am wonderfully well, and far better and
stronger than before what you call the Pisan 'crisis.'
Robert declares that nobody would know me, I <i>look</i> so
much better. And you heard from dearest Henrietta. Ah,
both of my dearest sisters have been perfect to me. No
words can express my feelings towards their goodness.
Otherwise, I have good accounts from home of my father's
excellent health and spirits, which is better even than to hear
of his loving and missing me. I had a few kind lines yesterday
from Miss Martineau, who invites us from Florence to
Westmoreland. She wants to talk to me, she says, of 'her
beloved Jordan.' She is looking forward to a winter of
work by the lakes, and to a summer of gardening. The
kindest of letters Robert has had from Carlyle, who makes
us very happy by what he says of our marriage. Shakespeare's
favorite air of the 'Light of Love,' with the full
evidence of its being Shakespeare's favorite air, is given in
Charles Knight's edition. Seek for it there. Now do write
to me and at length, and tell me everything of yourself.
Flush hated Vallombrosa, and was frightened out of his
wits by the pine forests. Flush likes civilised life, and the
society of little dogs with turned-up tails, such as Florence
abounds with. Unhappily it abounds also with <i>fleas</i>, which
afflict poor Flush to the verge sometimes of despair. Fancy
Robert and me down on our knees combing him, with a
basin of water on one side! He suffers to such a degree
from fleas that I cannot bear to witness it. He tears off his
pretty curls through the irritation. Do you know of a
remedy? Direct to me, Poste Restante, Florence. Put <i>via</i>
France. Let me hear, do; and everything of yourself,
mind. Is Mrs. Partridge in better spirits? Do you read
any new French books? Dearest friend, let me offer you
my husband's cordial regards, with the love of your own
affectionate</p>

<br /><br />

<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
Florence: September 1847.<br />

<p>Yes, indeed, my dear Mr. Westwood, I have seen
'friars.' We have been on a pilgrimage to Vallombrosa,
and while my husband rode up and down the precipitous
mountain paths, I and my maid and Flush were dragged in
a hamper by two white bullocks&mdash;and such scenery; such
hilly peaks, such black ravines and gurgling waters, and
rocks and forests above and below, and at last such a
monastery and such friars, who wouldn't let us stay with
them beyond five days for fear of corrupting the fraternity.
The monks had a new abbot, a St. Sejanus of a holy man,
and a petticoat stank in his nostrils, said he, and all the I
beseeching which we could offer him with joined hands was
classed with the temptations of St. Anthony. So we had
to come away as we went, and get the better as we could of
our disappointment, and really it was a disappointment not
to be able to stay our two months out in the wilderness as
we had planned it, to say nothing of the heat of Florence,
to which at the moment it was not pleasant to return. But
we got new lodgings in the shade and comforted ourselves
as well as we could. 'Comforted'&mdash;there's a word for
Florence&mdash;that ingratitude was a slip of the pen, believe
me. Only we had set our hearts upon a two months'
seclusion in the deep of the pine forests (which have such
a strange dialect in the silence they speak with), and the
mountains were divine, and it was provoking to be crossed
in our ambitions by that little holy abbot with the red face,
and to be driven out of Eden, even to Florence. It is said,
observe, that Milton took his description of Paradise from
Vallombrosa&mdash;so driven out of Eden we were, literally. To
Florence, though! and what Florence is, the tongue of man
or poet may easily fail to describe. The most beautiful of
cities, with the golden Arno shot through the breast of her
like an arrow, and 'non dolet' all the same. For what
helps to charm here is the innocent gaiety of the people,
who, for ever at feast day and holiday celebrations, come
and go along the streets, the women in elegant dresses and
with glittering fans, shining away every thought of Northern
cares and taxes, such as make people grave in England.
No little orphan on a house step but seems to inherit,
naturally his slice of water-melon and bunch of purple
grapes, and the rich fraternise with the poor as we are
unaccustomed to see them, listening to the same music and
walking in the same gardens, and looking at the same
Raphaels even! Also we were glad to be here just now,
when there is new animation and energy given to Italy by
this new wonderful Pope, who is a great man and doing
greatly. I hope you give him your sympathies. Think
how seldom the liberation of a people begins from the
throne, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> from a papal throne, which is so high and
straight.<a name="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> And the spark spreads! here is even our Grand
Duke conceding the civic guard,<a name="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> and forgetting his Austrian
prejudices. The world learns, it is pleasant to observe....</p>

<p>So well I am, dear Mr. Westwood, and so happy after
a year's trial of the stuff of marriage, happier than ever,
perhaps, and the revolution is so complete that one has to
learn to stand up straight and steadily (like a landsman in a
sailing ship) before one can do any work with one's hand
and brain.</p>

<p>We have had a delightful letter from Carlyle, who loves
my husband, I am proud to say.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
[Florence:] October 1, 1847 [postmark].<br />

<p>Ever dearest Miss Mitford,&mdash;I am delighted to have your
letter, and lose little time in replying to it. The lost letter
meanwhile does not appear. The moon has it, to make
more shine on these summer nights; if still one may say
'summer' now that September is deep and that we are cool
as people hoped to be when at hottest.... Do tell me your
full thought of the commonwealth of women.<a name="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> I begin by
agreeing with you as to his implied under-estimate of women;
his women are too voluptuous; however, of the most
refined voluptuousness. His gardener's daughter, for
instance, is just a rose: and 'a Rose,' one might beg
all poets to observe, is as precisely <i>sensual</i> as fricasseed
chicken, or even boiled beef and carrots. Did you read
Mrs. Butler's 'Year of Consolation,' and how did you think
of it in the main? As to Mr. Home's illustrations of national
music, I don't know; I feel a little jealous of his doing
well what many inferior men have done well&mdash;men who
couldn't write 'Orion' and the 'Death of Marlowe.' Now,
dearest dear Miss Mitford, you shall call him 'tiresome' if
you like, because I never heard him talk, and he may be
tiresome for aught I know, of course; but you <i>sha'n't</i> say
that he has not done some fine things in poetry. Now,
you <i>know</i> what the first book of 'Orion' is, and 'Marlowe,'
and 'Cosmo;' and you <i>sha'n't</i> say that you don't know it,
and that when you forgot it for a moment, I did not remind
you.... It was our plan to leave Florence on the 21st.
We stay, however, one month longer, half through temptation,
half through reason. Which is strongest, who knows?
We quite love Florence, and have delightful rooms; and
then, though I am quite well now as to my general health,
it is thought better for me to travel a month hence. So I
suppose we shall stay. In the meanwhile our Florentines
kept the anniversary of our wedding day (and the establishment
of the civic guard) most gloriously a day or two or
three ago, forty thousand persons flocking out of the
neighbourhood to help the expression of public sympathy
and overflowing the city. The procession passed under our
eyes into the Piazza Pitti, where the Grand Duke and all his
family stood at the palace window melting into tears, to
receive the thanks of his people. The joy and exultation on
all sides were most affecting to look upon. Grave men
kissed one another, and grateful young women lifted up their
children to the level of their own smiles, and the children
themselves mixed their shrill little <i>vivas</i> with the shouts of
the people. At once, a more frenetic gladness and a more
innocent manifestation of gladness were never witnessed.
During three hours and a half the procession wound on
past our windows, and every inch of every house seemed
alive with gazers all that time, the white handkerchiefs
fluttering like doves, and clouds of flowers and laurel
leaves floating down on the heads of those who passed.
Banners, too, with inscriptions to suit the popular
feeling&mdash;'Liberty'&mdash;the 'Union of Italy'&mdash;the 'Memory of
the Martyrs'&mdash;'Viva Pio Nono'&mdash;'Viva Leopoldo Secondo'&mdash;were
quite stirred with the breath of the shouters. I am glad to
have seen that sight, and to be in Italy at this moment, when
such sights are to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> My wrist aches a little even
now with the waving I gave to my handkerchief, I assure
you, for Robert and I and Flush sate the whole sight out at
the window, and would not be reserved with the tribute of
our sympathy. Flush had his two front paws over the
window sill, with his ears hanging down, but he confessed
at last that he thought they were rather long about it,
particularly as it had nothing to do with dinner and chicken
bones and subjects of consequence. He is less tormented
and looks better; in excellent spirits and appetite always&mdash;and
<i>thinner</i>, like your Flush&mdash;and very fond of Robert, as
indeed he ought to be. On the famous evening of that
famous day I have been speaking of, we lost him&mdash;he ran
away and stayed away all night&mdash;which was too bad,
considering that it was our anniversary besides, and that he
had no right to spoil it. But I imagine he was bewildered
with the crowd and the illumination, only as he <i>did</i> look so
very guilty and conscious of evil on his return, there's room
for suspecting him of having been very much amused,
'motu proprio,' as our Grand Duke says in the edict. He
was found at nine o'clock in the morning at the door of our
apartment, waiting to be let in&mdash;mind, I don't mean the
Grand Duke. Very few acquaintances have we made at
Florence, and very quietly lived out our days. Mr. Powers
the sculptor is our chief friend and favorite, a most
charming, simple, straight-forward, genial American, as
simple as the man of genius he has proved himself needs
be. He sometimes comes to talk and take coffee with us,
and we like him much. His wife is an amiable woman,
and they have heaps of children from thirteen downwards,
all, except the eldest boy, Florentines, and the sculptor has
eyes like a wild Indian's, so black and full of light. You
would scarcely wonder if they clave the marble without the
help of his hands. We have seen besides the Hoppners,
Lord Byron's friends at Venice, you will remember. And
Miss Boyle, the niece of the Earl of Cork, and authoress
and poetess on her own account, having been introduced
once to Robert in London at Lady Morgan's, has hunted
us out and paid us a visit. A very vivacious little person,
with sparkling talk enough. Lord Holland has lent her
mother and herself the famous Careggi Villa, where Lorenzo
the Magnificent died, and they have been living there
among the vines these four months. These and a few
American visitors are all we have seen at Florence. We
live a far more solitary life than you do, in your village and
with the 'prestige' of the country wrapping you round.
Pray give your sympathies to our Pope, and call him a great
man. For liberty to spring from a throne is wonderful, but
from a papal throne is miraculous. That's my doxy. I
suppose dear Mr. Kenyon and Mr. Chorley are still abroad.
French books I get at, but at scarcely a new one, which is
very provoking. At Rome it may be better. I have not
read 'Martin' even, since the first volume in England, nor
G. Sand's 'Lucretia.'</p>

<p>May God bless you. Think sometimes of your ever
affectionate
E.B.B.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<p>The 'month' lengthened itself out, and December
found the Brownings still in Florence, and definitely
established there for the winter. During this time,
although there is no allusion to it in the letters, Mrs.
Browning must have been engaged in writing the first part
of 'Casa Guidi Windows' with its hopeful aspirations for
Italian liberty. It was, indeed, a time when hope seemed
justifiable. Pius IX. had ascended the papal throne&mdash;then
a temporal as well as a spiritual sovereignty&mdash;in June 1846,
with the reputation of being anxious to introduce liberal
reforms, and even to promote the formation of a united
Italy. The English Government was diplomatically advocating
reform, in spite of the opposition of Austria; and its
representative, Lord Minto, who was sent on a special
mission to Italy to bring this influence to bear on the rulers
of the various Italian States, was received with enthusiastic
joy by the zealots for Italian liberty. The Grand Duke of
Tuscany, as was noticed above, had taken the first step in
the direction of popular government by the institution of a
National Guard; and Charles Albert of Piedmont was
always supposed to have the cause of Italy at heart in spite
of the vacillations of his policy. The catastrophe of 1848
was still in the distance; and for the moment a friend of
freedom and of Italy might be permitted to hope much.</p>

<p>Yet a difference will be noticed between the tone of Mrs.
Browning's letters at this time and that which marks her
language in 1859. In 1847 she was still comparatively new
to the country. She is interested in the experiment which
she sees enacted before her; she feels, as any poet must
feel, the attraction of the idea of a free and united Italy.
But her heart is not thrown into the struggle as it was at a
later time. She can write, and does, for the most part,
write, of other matters. The disappointment of Milan and
Novara could not break her heart, as the disappointment of
Villafranca went near to doing. They are not, indeed, so
much as mentioned in detail in the letters that follow. It
is in 'Casa Guidi Windows'&mdash;the first part written in 1847-8,
the second in 1851&mdash;that her reflections upon Italian
politics, alike in their hopes and in their failures, must be
sought.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: December 8, 1847.<br />

<p>Have you thought me long, my dearest Miss Mitford, in
writing? When your letter came we were distracted by
various uncertainties, torn by wild horses of sundry speculations,
and then, when one begins by delay in answering a
letter, you are aware how a silence grows and grows. Also
I heard <i>of</i> you through my sisters and Mrs. Duprey[?], and
<i>that</i> made me lazier still. Now don't treat me according to
the Jewish law, an eye for an eye; no! but a heart for a
heart, if you please; and you never can have reason to
reproach mine for not loving you. Think what we have
done since I wrote last to you. Taken two houses, that is,
two apartments, each for six months, presigning the contract.
You will set it down as excellent poet's work in the
way of domestic economy; but the fault was altogether mine
as usual, and my husband, to please me, took rooms which
I could not be pleased by three days, through the absence
of sunshine and warmth. The consequence was that we had
to pay heaps of guineas away for leave to go away ourselves,
any alternative being preferable to a return of illness, and I
am sure I should have been ill if we had persisted in staying
there. You can scarcely fancy the wonderful difference
which the sun makes in Italy. Oh, he isn't a mere 'round
O' in the air in this Italy, I assure you! He makes us feel
that he rules the day to all intents and purposes. So away
we came into the blaze of him here in the Piazza Pitti,
precisely opposite the Grand Duke's palace, I with my
remorse, and poor Robert without a single reproach. Any
other man, a little lower than the angels, would have
stamped and sworn a little for the mere relief of the thing,
but as to <i>his</i> being angry with <i>me</i> for any cause, except not
eating enough dinner, the said sun would turn the wrong
way first. So here we are on the Pitti till April, in small
rooms yellow with sunshine from morning to evening; and
most days I am able to get out into the piazza, and walk up
and down for some twenty minutes without feeling a shadow
of breath from the actual winter. Also it is pleasant to
be close to the Raffaels, to say nothing of the immense
advantage of the festa days, when, day after day, the civic
guard comes to show the whole population of Florence,
their Grand Duke inclusive, the new helmets and epaulettes
and the glory thereof. They have swords, too, I believe,
somewhere. The crowds come and come, like children to
see rows of dolls, only the children would tire sooner than
the Tuscans. Robert said musingly the other morning as
we stood at the window, 'Surely, after all this, they would
<i>use</i> those muskets.' It's a problem, a 'grand peut-&ecirc;tre.'
I was rather amused by hearing lately that our civic heroes
had the gallantry to propose to the ancient military that
these last should do the night work, i.e. when nobody was
looking on and there was no credit, as they found it dull and
fatiguing. Ah, one laughs, you see; one can't help it now
and then. But at the real and rising feeling of the people
by night and day one doesn't laugh indeed. I hear and see
with the deepest sympathy of soul, on the contrary. I love
the Italians, too, and none the less that something of the
triviality and innocent vanity of children abounds in them.
A delightful and most welcome letter was the last you sent
me, my dearest friend. Your bridal visit must have charmed
you, and I am glad you had the gladness of witnessing some
of the happiness of your friend, Mrs. Acton Tyndal, <i>you</i> who
have such quick sympathies, and to whom the happiness
of a friend is a gain counted in your own. The swan's
shadow is something in a clear water. For poor Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;,
if she is really, as you say Mrs. Tyndal thinks, pining
in an access of literary despondency, why <i>that</i> only
proves to me that she is not happy otherwise, that her life
and soul are not sufficiently filled for her woman's need. I
cannot believe of any woman that she can think of <i>fame
first</i>. A woman of genius may be absorbed, indeed, in the
exercise of an active power, engrossed in the charges of the
course and the combat; but this is altogether different to
a vain and bitter longing for prizes, and what prizes, oh,
gracious heavens! The empty cup of cold metal! <i>so</i> cold,
<i>so</i> empty to a woman with a heart. So, if your friend's
belief is true, still more deeply do I pity that other friend,
who is supposed to be unhappy from such a cause. A few
days ago I saw a bride of my own family, Mrs. Reynolds, Arlette
Butler, who married Captain Reynolds some five months
since.... Many were her exclamations at seeing me. She
declared that such a change was never seen, I was so transfigured
with my betterness: 'Oh, Ba, it is quite wonderful
indeed!' We had been calculated on, during her three
months in Rome, as a 'piece of resistance,' and it was a
disappointment to find us here in a corner with the salt.
Just as I was praised was poor Flush criticised. Flush has
not recovered from the effects yet of the summer plague of
fleas, and his curls, though growing, are not grown. I
never saw him in such spirits nor so ugly; and though
Robert and I flatter ourselves upon 'the sensible improvement,'
Arlette could only see him with reference to the
past, when in his Wimpole Street days he was sleek and
over fat, and she cried aloud at the loss of his beauty.
Then we have had [another] visitor, Mr. Hillard, an American
critic, who reviewed me in [the old] world, and so came to
<i>view</i> me in the new, a very intelligent man, of a good, noble
spirit. And Miss Boyle, ever and anon, comes at night,
at nine o'clock, to catch us at our hot chestnuts and mulled
wine, and warm her feet at our fire; and a kinder, more
cordial little creature, full of talent and accomplishment,
never had the world's polish on it. Very amusing, too,
she is, and original, and a good deal of laughing she and
Robert make between them. Did I tell you of her before,
and how she is the niece of Lord Cork, and poetess by
grace of certain Irish Muses? Neither of us know her
writings in any way, but we like her, and for the best
reasons. And this is nearly all, I think, we see of the 'face
divine,' masculine and feminine, and I can't make Robert
go out a single evening, not even to a concert, nor to hear
a play of Alfieri's, yet we fill up our days with books and
music (and a little writing has its share), and wonder at the
clock for galloping. It's twenty-four o'clock with us almost
as soon as we begin to count. Do tell me of Tennyson's
book, and of Miss Martineau's. I was grieved to hear a
distant murmur of a rumour of an apprehension of a return
of her complaint: somebody said that she could not bear
the <i>pressure of dress</i>, and that the exhaustion resulting from
the fits of absorption in work and enthusiasm on the new
subject of Egypt was painfully great, and that her friends
feared for her. I should think that the bodily excitement
and fatigue of her late travels must have been highly
hazardous, and that indeed, throughout her convalescence,
she should have more spared herself in climbing hills and
walking and riding distances. A strain obviously might
undo everything. Still, I do hope that the bitter cup may
not be filled for her again. What a wonderful discovery
this substitute for ether inhalations<a name="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> seems to be. Do you
hear anything of its operation in your neighbourhood? We
have had a letter from Mr. Horne, who appears happy, and
speaks of his success in lecturing on Ireland, and of a new
novel which he is about to publish in a separate form after
having printed it in a magazine. We have not set up the
types even of our <i>plans</i> about a book, very distinctly, but
we shall do something some day, and you shall hear of it
the evening before. Being too happy doesn't agree with
literary activity quite as well as I should have thought;
and then, dear Mr. Kenyon can't persuade us that we are
not rich enough, so as to bring into force a lower order of
motives. He talks of Rome still. Now write, dear,
dearest Miss Mitford, and tell me of yourself and your
health, and do, <i>do</i> love me as you used to do. As to
French books, one may swear, but you can't get a new
publication, except by accident, at this excellent celebrated
library of Vieusseux, and I am reduced to read some of
my favorites over again, I and Robert together. You ought
to hear how we go to single combat, ever and anon, with
shield and lance. The greatest quarrel we have had since
our marriage, by the way (always excepting my crying
conjugal wrong of not eating enough!), was brought up
by Masson's pamphlet on the Iron Mask and Fouquet. I
wouldn't be persuaded that Fouquet was 'in it,' and so
'the anger of my lord waxed hot.' To this day he says
sometimes: 'Don't be cross, Ba! <i>Fouquet wasn't the Iron
Mask after all</i>.'</p>

<p>God bless you, dearest Miss Mitford.<br />

<p>We are here till April.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Florence: December 1847.<br />

<p>Indeed, my dear friend, you have a right to complain of
<i>me</i>, whether or not <i>we</i> had any in thinking ourselves deeply
injured creatures by your last silence. Yet when in your
letter which came at last, you said, 'Write directly,' I <i>meant</i>
to write directly; I did not take out my vengeance in a
foregone malice, be very sure. Just at the time we were in
a hard knot of uncertainties about Rome and Venice and
Florence, and a cold house and a warm house; for instance
we managed (that is <i>I</i> did, for altogether it was my fault) to
take two apartments in the course of ten days, each for a
term of six months, getting out of one of them by leaving
the skirts of our garments, <i>rent</i>, literally, in the hand of the
proprietor. You have heard most of this, I dare say, from
Mr. Kenyon or my sisters. Now, too, you are aware of our
being in Piazza Pitti, in a charmed circle of sun blaze. Our
rooms are small, but of course as cheerful as being under the
very eyelids of the sun must make everything; and we have
a cook in the house who takes the office of <i>traiteur</i> on him
and gives us English mutton chops at Florentine prices,
both of us quite well and in spirits, and (though you never
will believe this) happier than ever. For my own part, you
know I need not say a word if it were not true, and I must
say to you, who saw the beginning with us, that this end of
fifteen months is just fifteen times better and brighter; the
mystical 'moon' growing larger and larger till scarcely room is
left for any stars at all: the only differences which have
touched me being the more and more happiness. It would
have been worse than unreasonable if in marrying I had expected
one quarter of such happiness, and indeed I did not,
to do myself justice, and every now and then I look round
in astonishment and thankfulness together, yet with a sort of
horror, seeing that this is not heaven after all. We live just
as we did when you knew us, just as shut-up a life. Robert
never goes anywhere except to take a walk with Flush, which
isn't my fault, as you may imagine: he has not been out one
evening of the fifteen months; but what with music and books
and writing and talking, we scarcely know how the days go, it's
such a gallop on the grass. We are going through some
of old Sacchetti's novelets now: characteristic work for
Florence, if somewhat dull elsewhere. Boccaccios can't be
expected to spring up with the vines in rows, even in this
climate. We got a newly printed addition to Savonarola's
poems the other day, very flat and cold, they did not catch
fire when he was burnt. The most poetic thing in the book
is his face on the first page, with that eager, devouring soul
in the eyes of it. You may suppose that I am able sometimes
to go over to the gallery and adore the Raphaels, and
Robert will tell you of the divine Apollino which you missed
seeing in Poggio Imperiale, and which I shall be set face to
face before, some day soon, I hope....</p>

<p>Father Prout was in Florence for some two hours in
passing to Rome, and of course, according to contract of
spirits of the air, Robert met him, and heard a great deal
of you and Geddie (saw Geddie's picture, by the way, and
thought it very like), was told much to the advantage of Mr.
Macpherson,<a name="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> and at the end of all, kissed in the open street
as the speaker was about to disappear in the diligence. When
you write, tell me of the <i>book</i>. Surely it will be out anon,
and then you will be free, shall you not? Have you seen
Tennyson's new poem, and what of it? Miss Martineau is
to discourse about Egypt, I suppose; but in the meanwhile
do you hear that she forswears mesmerism, as Mr. Spenser
Hall does, according to the report Robert brings me home
from the newspaper reading. Now I shall leave him room
to stand on and speak a word to you. Give my love to
Gerardine, and don't forget to mention her letter. I hope
you are happy about your friends, and that, in particular,
Lady Byron's health is strengthening and to strengthen.
Always my dear friend's</p>

<p>Most affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Nina,&mdash;A corner is just the place for eating
Christmas pies in, but for venting Christmas wishes, hardly!
What has Ba told you and wished you in the way of love?
I wish you the same and love you the same, but Geddie,
being part of you, gets her due part. We are as happy as
two owls in a hole, two toads under a tree stump; or any
other queer two poking creatures that we let live, after the
fashion of their black hearts, only Ba is fat and rosy; yes,
indeed! Florence is empty and pleasant. Goodbye, therefore,
till next year&mdash;shall it not be then we meet? God bless
you. R.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: February 22, [1848].<br />

<p>Your letter, my dearest friend, which was written, a part
at least, before Christmas, came lingering in long after
the new year had seen out its matins. Oh, I had wondered
so, and wished so over the long silence. My fault, perhaps
in a measure, for I know how silent <i>I</i> was before. Yes,
and you tell me of your having been unwell (bad news), and
of your dear Flush's death, which made me sorrowful for
you, as I might reasonably be. And now tell me more.
Have you a successor to him? Once you told me that
one of the race was in training, but as you say nothing now
I am all in a doubt. Let me hear everything. If I had
been you, I think I should have preferred some quite other
kind of dog, as the unlikeness of a likeness would be apt to
bring a pain to me; but people can't reason about feelings,
and feelings are like the colour of eyes, not the same in
different faces, however general may be the proximity of
noses.... The great subject with <i>everybody</i> just now is
the new hope of Italy, and the liberal constitution, given
nobly by our good, excellent Grand Duke, whose praise is
in all the houses, streets, and piazzas. The other evening,
the evening after the gift, he went privately to the opera,
was recognised, and in a burst of triumph and a glory of
waxen torches was brought back to the Pitti by the people.
I was undressing to go to bed, had my hair down over my
shoulders under Wilson's ministry, when Robert called me
to look out of the window and see. Through the dark
night a great flock of stars seemed sweeping up the piazza,
but not in silence, nor with very heavenly noises. The
'<i>Evvivas</i>' were deafening. So glad I was. <i>I, too</i>, stood at
the window and clapped my hands. If ever Grand Duke
deserved benediction this Duke does. We hear that he
was quite moved, overpowered, and wept like a child.
Nevertheless the most of Italy is under the cloud, and God
knows how all may end as the thunder ripens. Now I
mustn't, I suppose, write politics. Our plans about England
are afloat. Impossible to know what we shall do, but if not
this summer, the summer after <i>must</i> help us to the sight
of some beloved faces. It will be a midsummer dream, and
we shall return to winter in Italy. My Flush is as well as
ever, and perhaps gayer than ever I knew him. He runs
out in the piazza whenever he pleases, and plays with the
dogs when they are pretty enough, and wags his tail at the
sentinels and civic guard, and takes the Grand Duke as a
sort of neighbour of his, whom it is proper enough to
patronise, but who has considerably less inherent merit and
dignity than the spotted spaniel in the alley to the left. We
have been reading over again 'Andr&eacute;' and 'Leone Leoni,'<a name="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>
and Robert is in an enthusiasm about the first. Happy
person, you are, to get so at new books. Blessed is the
man who reads Balzac, or even Dumas. I have got to
admire Dumas doubly since that fight and scramble for his
brains in Paris. Now do think of me and love me, and let
me be as ever your affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>

<p>Robert's regards always. Say particularly how you are,
and may God bless you, dearest Miss Mitford, and make
you happy.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: April 15, [1848].<br />

<p>... My Flush has recovered his beauty, and is in
more vivacious spirits than I remember to have seen him.
Still, the days come when he will have no pleasure and
plenty of fleas, poor dog, for Savonarola's martyrdom here
in Florence is scarcely worse than Flush's in the summer.
Which doesn't prevent his enjoying the spring, though, and
just now, when, by medical command, I drive out two
hours every day, his delight is to occupy the seat in the
carriage opposite to Robert and me, and look disdainfully
on all the little dogs who walk afoot. We drive day by day
through the lovely Cascine (where the trees have finished
and spread their webs of full greenery, undimmed by the
sun yet), first sweeping through the city, past such a window
where Bianca Capello looked out to see the Duke go by,<a name="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>
and past such a door where Lapo stood, and past the famous
stone where Dante drew his chair out to sit.<a name="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> Strange,
to have all that old-world life about us, and the blue sky so
bright besides, and ever so much talk on our lips about the
new French revolution, and the King of Prussia's cunning,
and the fuss in Germany and elsewhere. Not to speak of
our own particular troubles and triumphs in Lombardy close
by. The English are flying from Florence, by the way, in
a helter skelter, just as they always do fly, except (to do
them justice) on a field of battle. The family Englishman
is a dreadful coward, be it admitted frankly. See how they
run from France, even to my dear excellent Uncle Hedley,
who has too many little girls in his household to stay
longer at Tours. Oh, I don't <i>blame</i> him exactly. I only
wish that he had waited a little longer, the time necessary
for being quite reassured. He has great stakes in the
country&mdash;a house at Tours and in Paris, and twenty
thousand pounds in the Rouen railway. But Florence will
fall upon her feet we may all be certain, let the worst
happen that can. Meanwhile, republicans as I and my,
husband are by profession, we very anxiously, anxiously even
to pain, look on the work being attempted and done just
now by the theorists in Paris; far from half approving of it
we are, and far from being absolutely confident of the durability
of the other half. Tell me what you think, and if you
are not anxious too. As to communism, surely the
practical part of <i>that</i>, the only not dangerous part, is
attainable simply by the consent of individuals who may
try the experiment of associating their families in order to
the cheaper employment of the means of life, and successfully
in many cases. But make a government scheme of
<i>even so much</i>, and you seem to trench on the individual
liberty. All such patriarchal planning in a government
issues naturally into absolutism, and is adapted to states of
society more or less barbaric. Liberty and civilisation
when married together lawfully rather evolve individuality
than tend to generalisation. Is this not true? I fear, I
fear that mad theories promising the impossible may, in
turn, make the people mad. I Louis Blanc knows not what
he says. Have I not mentioned to you a very gifted
woman, a sculptress, Mademoiselle de Fauveau, who lives
in Florence with her mother practising her profession, an
exile from France, in consequence of their royalist opinions
and participation in the Vend&eacute;e struggle, some sixteen or
fifteen years? On that occasion she was mistaken for and
allowed herself to be arrested as Madame de la Roche
Jacquelin; therefore she has justified, by suffering in the
cause, her passionate attachment to it. A most interesting
person she is; she called upon us a short time ago and interested
us much. And Mrs. Jameson would tell you that her
celebrity in her art is not comparative 'for a woman,' but
that, since Benvenuto Cellini, more beautiful works of the
kind have not been accomplished. An exquisite fountain
she has lately done for the Emperor of Russia. She has
workmen under her, and is as 'professional' in every
respect as if neither woman nor noble. At the first throb
of this revolution of course she dreamt the impossible
about that dear 'Henri Cinq,' who is as much out of the
question as Henri Quatre himself; and now it ends with the
'French Legation' coming to settle in the house precisely
opposite to hers, with a hideous sign-painting appended O
the Gallic cock on one leg and at full crow inscribed,
'Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;.' This, and the death of her
favorite dog, whom, after seventeen years' affection, she
was forced to have destroyed on account of a combination
of diseases, has quite saddened the sculptress. When she
came to see us I observed that after so long a residence at
Florence she must regard it as a second country. 'Ah
non!' (the answer was) 'il n'y a pas de seconde patrie.'
What you tell me of 'Jane Eyre' makes me long to see the
book. I may long, I fancy. It is dismal to have to
disappoint my dearest sisters, who hoped for me in England
this summer, but our English visit <i>must</i> be for next
summer instead; there seems too much against it just now.
The drawback of Italy is the distance from England. If it
were but as near as Paris, for instance, why in that case we
should settle here at once, I do think, the conveniences and
luxuries of life are of such incredible cheapness, the climate
so divine, and the way of things altogether so serene and
suited to our tastes and instincts. But to give up England
and the <i>English</i>, the dear, dearest treasure of English love,
is impossible, so we just linger and linger. The Boyles go
to England from the press of panic, Lady Boyle being old
and infirm. Ah, but your talking friend would interest
you, and you might accept the talk in infinitesimal doses,
you know. Lamartine has surely acted down the fallacy
of the impractical tendencies of imaginative men. I am
full of France just now. Are you all prepared for an
outbreak in Ireland? I hope so. My husband has the
second edition of his collected poems<a name="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> in the press by this
time, by grace of Chapman and Hall, who accept all risks.
You speak of Tennyson's vexation about the reception of
the 'Princess.' Why did Mr. Harness and others, who
'never could understand' his former divine works, praise
this in manuscript till the poet's hope grew to the height of
his ambition? Strangely unfortunate. We have not read
it yet. I hear that Tennyson had the other day everything
packed for Italy, then turned his face toward Ireland, and
went there. Oh, for a talk with you. But this is a sort of
talk, isn't it? Accept my husband's regards. As to my
love, I throw it to you over the [sea] with both hands.
God bless you.</p>

<i>To John Kenyan</i><br />
[Florence:] May I, [1848].<br />

<p>My dearest Mr. Kenyon,&mdash;Surely it is quite wrong that
we three, Robert, you, and I, should be satisfied with
writing little dry notes, as short as so many proclamations,
and those of the order of your anti-Chartist magistracy,
'Whereas certain evil disposed persons &amp;c. &amp;c.,' instead of
our anti-Austrian Grand duchy's 'O figli amati' (how
characteristic of the north and the south, to be sure, is this
contrast! Yet, after all, they might have managed it
rather better in England!)&mdash;little dry notes brief and
business-like as an anti-Chartist proclamation! And,
indeed, two of us are by no means satisfied, whatever the
third may be. The other day we were looking over some
of the dear delightful letters you used to write to us. Real
letters those were, and not little dry notes at all. Robert
said, 'When I write to dear Mr. Kenyon I really do feel
overcome by the sense of what I owe to him, and so, as it
is beyond words to say, why generally I say as little as
possible of anything, keeping myself to matters of business.'
An alternative very objectionable, I told him; for to have
'a dumb devil' from ever such grateful and sentimental
reasons, when the Alps stand betwixt friend, is damnatory
in the extreme. Then, as <i>you</i> are not 'too grateful' to <i>us</i>,
why don't <i>you</i> write? Pray do, my dear friend. Let us
all write as we used to do. And to make sure of it, I
begin.</p>

<p>Since I ended last the world has turned over on its
other side, in order, one must hope, to some happy change
in the dream. Our friend, Miss Bayley, in that very kind
letter which has just reached me and shall be answered
directly (will you tell her with my thankful love?), asks
if Robert and I are communists, and then half draws back
her question into a discreet reflection that <i>I</i>, at least, was
never much celebrated for acumen on political economy.
Most true indeed! And therefore, and on that very ground,
is it not the more creditable to me that I don't set up for a
communist immediately? In proportion to the ignorance
might be the stringency of the embrace of 'la v&eacute;rit&eacute; sociale:'
so I claim a little credit that it isn't. For really we are not
communists, farther than to admit the wisdom of voluntary
association in matters of material life among the poorer
classes. And to legislate even on such points seems as
objectionable as possible; all intermeddlings of government
with domesticities, from Lacedaemon to Peru, were and
must be objectionable; and of the growth of absolutism, let
us, theorise as we choose. I would have the government
educate the people absolutely, and <i>then</i> give room for the
individual to develop himself into life freely. Nothing
can be more hateful to me than this communist idea of
quenching individualities in the mass. As if the hope
of the world did not always consist in the eliciting of the
individual man from the background of the masses, in the
evolvement of individual genius, virtue, magnanimity. Do
you know how I love France and the French? Robert
laughs at me for the mania of it, or used to laugh long
before this revolution. When I was a prisoner, my other
mania for imaginative literature used to be ministered to
through the prison bars by Balzac, George Sand, and the
like immortal improprieties. They kept the colour in my
life to some degree and did good service in their time to
me, I can assure you, though in dear discreet England
women oughtn't to confess to such reading, I believe, or
you told me so yourself one day. Well, but through
reading the books I grew to love France, in a mania too;
and the interest, which all must feel in the late occurrences
there, has been with me, and is, quite painful. I read the
newspapers as I never did in my life, and hope and fear in
paroxysms, yes, and am guilty of thinking far more of Paris
than of Lombardy itself, and try to understand financial
difficulties and social theories with the best will in the
world; much as Flush tries to understand me when I tell
him that barking and jumping may be unseasonable things.
Both of us open our eyes a good deal, but the comprehension
is questionable after all. What, however, I do seem
least of all to comprehend, is your hymn of triumph in
England, just because you have a lower ideal of liberty
than the French people have. See if in Louis Philippe's
time France was not in many respects more advanced
than England is now, property better divided, hereditary
privilege abolished! Are we to blow with the trumpet
because we respect the ruts while everywhere else they
are mending the roads? I do not comprehend. As to
the Chartists, it is only a pity in my mind that you have
not more of them. That's their fault. Mine, you will say,
is being pert about politics when you would rather have
anything else in a letter from Italy. You have heard of
my illness, and will have been sorry for me, I am certain;
but with blessings edging me round, I need not catch at a
thistle in the hedge to make a 'sorrowful complaignte' of.
Our plans have floated round and round, in and out of all
the bays and creeks of the Happy Islands....</p>

<p>Meanwhile here we are&mdash;and when do you mean to
come to see us, pray? Mind, I hold by the skirts of the
vision for next winter. Why, surely <i>you</i> won't talk of
'disturbances' and 'revolutions,' and the like disloyal reasons
which send our brave countrymen flying on all sides, as if
every separate individual expected to be bombarded <i>per se</i>.
Now, mind you come; dear dear Mr. Kenyon, how
delighted past expression we should be to see you! Ah,
do you fancy that I have no regret for our delightful gossips?
If I have the feeling I told you of for Balzac and George
Sand, what must I have for <i>you</i>? Now come, and let us
see you! And still sooner, if you please, write to us&mdash;and
write of yourself and in detail&mdash;and tell us particularly,
first if the winter has left no sign of a cough with you, and
next, what you mean by something which suggests to my
fancy that you have a book in the course of printing. Is
that true? Tell me all about it&mdash;<i>all</i>! Who can be
interested, pray, if <i>I</i> am not? For your and Mr. Chorley's
and Mr. Forster's kind dealings with Robert's poems I
thank you gratefully; and as a third volume can bring up
the rear quickly in the case of success, I make no wailing
for my 'Luria,' however dear it may be.<a name="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p>You are not to fancy that I am unwell now. On the
contrary, I am nearly as strong as ever, and go out in the carriage
for two hours every day, besides a little walk sometimes.
Not a word more to-day. Write&mdash;do&mdash;and you shall
hear from us at length. Robert sends his own love, I
suppose. We both love you from our hearts.</p>

<p>It was about this time, as appears from the following
letter, that the Brownings finally anchored themselves in
Florence by taking an unfurnished suite of rooms in the
Palazzo Guidi, and making there a home for themselves,
Here, in the Via Maggio, almost opposite the Pitti Palace,
and within easy distance of the Ponte Vecchio, is the
dwelling known to all lovers of English poetry as Casa
Guidi, and bearing now upon its walls the name of the
English poetess whose life and writings formed, in the

<p>... And now I must tell you what we have done since
I wrote last, little thinking of doing so. You see our
problem was to get to England as much in our summers as
possible, the expense of the intermediate journeys making
it difficult of solution. On examination of the whole case,
it appeared manifest that we were throwing money into the
like to hear you talk of poor France; how I hope that you
are able to hope for her. Oh, this absurdity of communism
and mythological f&ecirc;te-ism! where can it end? They had
better have kept Louis Philippe after all, if they are no
more practical. Your Madame must be insufferable indeed,
seeing that her knowledge of these subjects and men did
not make her sufferable to you. My curiosity never is
exhausted. What I hold is that the French have a higher
ideal than we, and that all this clambering, leaping, struggling
of indefinite awkwardness simply proves it. But <i>success in
the republic</i> is different still. I fear for them. My uncle
and his family are safe at Tunbridge Wells, my aunt longing
to be able to get back again. For those who are still nearer
to me, I have no heart to speak of <i>them</i>, loving them as I
do and must to the end, whatever that end may be; but
my dearest sisters write often to me&mdash;never let me miss
their affection. I am quite well again, and strong, and
Robert and I go out after tea in a wandering walk to sit in
the Loggia and look at the Perseus, or, better still, at
the divine sunsets on the Arno, turning it to pure gold
under the bridges. After more than twenty months of
marriage, we are happier than ever&mdash;I may say <i>we</i>. Italy
will regenerate herself in all senses, I hope and believe. In
Florence we are very quiet, and the English fly in proportion.
N.B.&mdash;<i>Always</i> first fly the majors and gallant
captains, unless there's a general. How I should like to
see dear Mr. Horne's poem! <i>He's</i> bold, at least&mdash;yes, and
has a great heart to be bold with. A cloud has fallen on
me some few weeks ago, in the illness and death of my
dear friend Mr. Boyd,<a name="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> but he did not suffer, and is not to
be mourned by those without hope [<i>sic</i>]. Still, it has been a
cloud. May God bless you, my beloved friend. Write
soon, and of yourself, to your ever affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>

<p>My husband's regards go to you, of course.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
[Florence: about June 1848.]<br />

<p>My dearest Sarianna,&mdash;At last, you see, I give sign of
life. The <i>love</i>, I hope you believed in without sign or
symbol; and even for the rest, Robert promised to answer
for me like godfather or godmother, and bear the consequence
of my sins....</p>

<p>We are a little uneasy just now as to whether you will
be overjoyed or <i>under</i> joyed by our new scheme of taking
an unfurnished apartment. It would spoil all, for instance,
if your dear mother seemed disappointed&mdash;vexed&mdash;in the
least degree. And I can understand how, to persons at a
distance and of course unable to understand the whole
circumstances of the case, the fact of an apartment taken
and furnished may seem to involve some dreadful giving up
for ever and ever of country and family&mdash;which would be
as dreadful to us as to you! How could we give you up,
do you think, when we love you more and more? Oh no.
If Robert has succeeded in making clear the subject to you,
you will all perceive, just as <i>we know</i>, that we have simply
thus solved the problem of making our small income carry
us to England, not only next summer, but many a summer
after. We should like to give every summer to dear
England, and hide away from the cold only when it comes.
By our scheme we shall have saved money even at the end
of the present year; while for afterward, here's a residence&mdash;that
is, a<i>pied &agrave; terre</i>&mdash;in Italy, all but free when we wish to
use it; and when we care to let it, producing eight or ten
pounds a month in help of travelling expenses. It's the
best investment for Mr. Moxon's money we could have
looked the world over for. So the learned tell us; and
after all, you know, we only pay in the proportion of your
working classes in the Pancras building contrived for them
by the philanthropy of your Southwood Smiths. I do wish
you could see what rooms we have, what ceilings, what
height and breadth, what a double terrace for orange trees;
how cool, how likely to be warm, how perfect every way!
Robert leaned once to a ground floor in the Frescobaldi Palace,
being bewitched by a garden full of camellias, and a little
pond of gold and silver fish; but while he saw the fish I saw
the mosquitos in clouds, such an apocalypse of them as has not
yet been visible to me in all Florence, and I dread mosquitos
more than Austrians; and he, in his unspeakable goodness,
deferred to my fear in a moment and gave up the camellias
without one look behind. A heavy conscience I should
have if it were not that the camellia garden was certainly less
private than our terrace here, where we can have camellias also
if we please. How pretty and pleasant your cottage at Windsor
must be! We had a long <i>muse</i> over your father's sketch of
it, and set faces at the windows. That the dear invalid is
better for the change must have brightened it, too, to her
companions, and the very sound of a 'forest' is something
peculiarly delightful and untried to me. I know hills well,
and of the sea too much; but now I want forests, or quite,
quite mountains, such as you have not in England.</p>

<p>Robert says that if 'Blackwood' likes to print a poem
of mine and send you the proofs, you will be so very good as
to like to correct them. To me it seems too much to ask,
when you have work for him to do beside. Will it be too
much, or is nothing so to your kindness? I would ask my
<i>other</i> sisters, who would gladly, dear things, do it for me;
but I have misgivings through their being so entirely
unaccustomed to occupations of the sort, or any critical
reading of poetry of any sort. Robert is quite well and in
the best spirits, and has the headache now only very
occasionally. I am as well as he, having quite recovered
my strength and power of walking. So we wander to the
bridge of Trinit&agrave; every evening after tea to see the sunset
on the Arno. May God bless you all! Give my true love
to your father and mother, and my loving thanks to yourself
for that last stitch in the stool. How good you are,
Sarianna, to your ever affectionate sister</p>

<p>BA.</p>

<p>Always remind your dear mother that we are no more
<i>bound</i> here than when in furnished lodgings. It is a mere
name.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Palazzo Guidi: June 20, [1848].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Now I am going to answer
your letter, which I all but lost, and got ever so many days
beyond the right day, because you directed it to Mrs.
<i>William</i> Browning. Pray remember <i>Robert Browning</i> for
the future, in right descent from <i>Robert Brunnyng</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> the first
English poet. Mrs. Jameson says, 'It's ominous of the
actual Robert's being the <i>last</i> English poet;' a saying which
I give you to remember us by, rejecting the omen.... We
have grown to be Florentine citizens, as perhaps you have
heard. Health and means both forbade our settlement in
England; and the journey backwards and forwards being
another sort of expense, and very necessary with our ties and
affections, we had to think how to live here, when we were
here, at the cheapest. The difference between taking a
furnished apartment and an unfurnished one is something
immense. For our furnished rooms we have had always
to pay some four guineas a month; and unfurnished rooms
of equal pretension we could have for twelve a year, and the
furniture (out and out) for fifty pounds. This calculation,
together with the consideration that we could let our apartment
whenever we travelled and receive back the whole
cost, could not choose, of course, but determine us. On
coming to the point, however, we grew ambitious, and
preferred giving five-and-twenty guineas for a noble suite of
rooms in the Palazzo Guidi, a stone's throw from the Pitti,
and furnishing them after our own taste rather than after
our economy, the economy having a legitimate share of
respect notwithstanding; and the satisfactory thing being
that the whole expense of this furnishing&mdash;rococo chairs,
spring sofas, carved bookcases, satin from cardinals' beds,
and the rest&mdash;is covered by the proceeds of our books
during the last two winters. This is satisfying, isn't it?
We shall stand safe within the borders of our narrow
income even this year, and next year comes the harvest!
We shall go to England in the spring, and return <i>home</i> to
Italy. Do you understand? Mr. Kenyon, our friend and
counsellor, writes to applaud&mdash;such prudence was never
known before among poets. Then we have a plan, that
when the summer (this summer) grows too hot, we shall just
take up our carpet-bag and Wilson and plunge into the
mountains in search of the monasteries beyond Vallombrosa,
from Arezzo go to St. Sepolchro in the Apennines, and
thence to Fano on the seashore, making a round back
perhaps (after seeing the great fair at Sinigaglia) to Ravenna
and Bologna home. As to Rome, our plan is to give up
Rome next winter, seeing that we <i>must</i> go to England in
the spring. I <i>must</i> see my dearest sisters and whoever else
dear will see me, and Robert <i>must</i> see his family beside; and
going to Rome will take us too far from the route and cost too
much; and then we are not inclined to give the first-fruits of
our new apartment to strangers if we could let it ever so easily
this year. You can't think how well the rooms look already;
you must come and see them, you and dear Mr. Martin.
Three immense rooms we have, and a fourth small one for
a book room and winter room&mdash;windows opening on a little
terrace, eight windows to the south; two good bedrooms
behind, with a smaller terrace, and kitchen, &amp;c., all on a
first floor and Count Guidi's favorite suite. The Guidi were
connected by marriage with the Ugolino of Pisa, Dante's
Ugolino, only we shun all traditions of the Tower of
Famine, and promise to give you excellent coffee whenever
you will come to give us the opportunity. We shall have
vines and myrtles and orange trees on the terrace, and I
shall have a watering-pot and garden just as you do, though
it must be on the bricks instead of the ground. For
temperature, the stoves are said to be very effective in the
winter, and in the summer we are cool and airy; the
advantage of these thick-walled palazzos is coolness in
summer and warmth in winter. I am very well and quite
strong again, or rather, stronger than ever, and able to walk
as far as Cellini's Perseus in the moonlight evenings, on
the other side of the Arno. Oh, that Arno in the sunset,
with the moon and evening star standing by, how divine it
is!...</p>

<p>Think of me as ever your most affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: July 4, [1848].<br />

<p>It does grieve me, my ever dearest Miss Mitford, to hear
of the suffering which has fallen upon you! Oh, rheumatism
or not, whatever the name may be, do take care, do
consider, and turn your dear face toward the seaside; somewhere
where you can have warm sea bathing and sea air,
and be able to associate the word 'a drive' not with mad
ponies, but the mildest of donkeys, on a flat sand. The
good it would do you is incalculable, I am certain; it is
precisely a case for change of air, with quiet....</p>

<p>As for when you come to Florence, we won't have 'a
pony carriage between us,' if you please, because we may
have a carriage and a pair of horses and a coachman, and
pay as little as for the pony-chair in England. For three
hundred a year one may live much like the Grand Duchess,
and go to the opera in the evening at fivepence-halfpenny
inclusive. Indeed, poor people should have their patriotism
tenderly dealt with, when, after certain experiments, they
decide on living upon the whole on the Continent. The
differences are past belief, beyond expectation, and when
the sunshine is thrown in, the head turns at once, and you
fall straight into absenteeism. Ah, for the 'long chats' and
the 'having England at one another's fireside!' You talk
of delightful things indeed. We are very quiet, politically
speaking, and though we hear now and then of melancholy
mothers who have to part with their sons for Lombardy,<a name="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p>and though there are processions for the blessing of flags
and an occasional firing of guns for a victory, or a cry in
the streets, 'Notizie della guerra&mdash;leggete, signori;' this is all
we know of Radetsky in Florence; while, for civil politics,
the meeting of the senate took place a few days since to the
satisfaction of everybody, and the Grand Duke's speech was
generally admired. The elections have returned moderate
men, and many land-proprietors, and Robert, who went out
to see the procession of members, was struck by the grave
thoughtful faces and the dignity of expression. We are
going some day to hear the debates, but it has pleased their
signoria to fix upon twelve (noon) for meeting, and really I
do not dare to go out in the sun. The hour is sufficiently
conclusive against dangerous enthusiasm. Poor France,
poor France! News of the dreadful massacre at Paris just
reaches us, and the letters and newspapers not arriving
to-day, everybody fears a continuation of the crisis. How
is it to end? Who 'despairs of the republic?' Why, <i>I</i> do!
I fear, I fear, that it cannot stand in France, and you seem
to have not much more hope. My husband has a little,
with melancholy intermediate prospects; but my own belief
that the people have had enough of democratic institutions
and will be impatient for a kingship anew. Whom
will they have? How did you feel when the cry was raised,
'Vive l'Empereur'? Only Prince Napoleon is a Napoleon
cut out in paper after all. The Prince de Joinville is said
to be very popular. It makes me giddy to think of the
awful precipices which surround France&mdash;to think, too, that
the great danger is on the question of <i>property</i>, which is
perhaps divided there more justly than in any other country
of Europe. Lamartine has comprehended nothing, that is
clear, even if his amount of energy had been effectual....
Yes, do send me the list of Balzac, <i>after</i> 'Les Mis&egrave;res de la
Vie Conjugale,' I mean. I left him in the midst of 'La
Femme de Soixante Ans,' who seemed on the point of
turning the heads of all 'la jeunesse' around her; and,
after all, she did not strike me as so charming. But Balzac
charms me, let him write what he will; he's an inspired
man. Tell me, too, exactly what Sue has done after 'Martin.'
I read only one volume of 'Martin.' And did poor Souli&eacute;
finish his 'Dramas'? And after 'Lucretia' what did George
Sand write? When Robert and I are ambitious, we talk of
buying Balzac in full some day, to put him up in our bookcase
from the convent, if the carved-wood angels, infants
and serpents, should not finish mouldering away in horror
at the touch of him. But I fear it will rather be an
expensive purchase, even here. Would that he gave up the
drama, for which, as you observe, he has no faculty whatever.
In fact, the faculty he has is the very reverse of the dramatic,
ordinarily understood.... Dearest Mr. Kenyon is called
quite well and delightful by the whole world, though he
suffered from cough in the winter; and he is bringing out
a new book of poems, a 'Day at Tivoli,' and others; and
he talks energetically of coming to Florence this autumn.
Also, we have hopes of Mr. Chorley. I congratulate you
on the going away of Madame. Coming and going bring
very various associations in this life of ours. Why, if <i>you</i>
were to come we should appreciate our fortune, and you
should have my particular chair, which Robert calls mine
because I like sitting in a cloud; it's so sybaritically soft a
chair. Now I love you for the kind words you say of <i>him</i>,
who deserves the best words of the best women and men,
wherever spoken! Yes, indeed, I am happy. Otherwise,
I should have a stone where the heart is, and sink by the
weight of it. You must have faith in me, for I never can
make you thoroughly to understand what he is, of himself,
and to me&mdash;the noblest and perfectest of human beings.
After a year and ten months' absolute soul-to-soul intercourse
and union, I have to look higher still for my first
ideal. You won't blame me for bad taste that I say these
things, for can I help it, when I am writing my heart to you?
It is a heart which runs over very often with a grateful joy
for a most peculiar destiny, even in the midst of some bitter
drawbacks which I need not allude to farther....</p>

<p>May God bless you continually, even as I am</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Palazzo Guidi: July 15, [1848].<br />

<p>Now at last, my very dear friend, I am writing to you,
and the reproach you sent to me in your letter shall not be
driven inwardly any more by my self-reproaches. Wasn't
it your fault after all, a little, that we did not hear one
another's voice oftener? You are <i>so long</i> in writing. Then
I have been putting off and putting off my letter to you,
just because I wanted to make a full letter of it; and
Robert always says that it's the bane of a correspondence to
make a full letter a condition of writing at all. But so
much I had to tell you! while the mere outline of facts you
had from others, I knew. Which is just said that you may
forgive us both, and believe that we think of you and love
you, yes, and talk of you, even when we don't write to you,
and that we shall write to you for the future more regularly,
indeed. Your letter, notwithstanding its reproach, was
very welcome and very kind, only you must be fagged with
the book, and saddened by Lady Byron's state of health,
and anxious about Gerardine perhaps. The best of all was
the prospect you hold out to us of coming to Italy this
year. Do, do come. Delighted we shall be to see you in
Florence, and wise it will be in you to cast behind your back
both the fear of Radetsky and as much English care as may
be. Now, would it not do infinite good to Lady Byron if
you could carry her with you into the sun? Surely it would
do her great good; the change, the calm, the atmosphere
of beauty and brightness, which harmonises so wonderfully
with every shade of human feeling. Florence just now,
and thanks to the panic, is tolerably <i>clean</i> of the
English&mdash;you scarcely see an English face anywhere&mdash;and perhaps
this was a circumstance that helped to give Robert courage
to take our apartment here and 'settle down.' You were
surprised at so decided a step I dare say, and, I believe,
though too considerate to say it in your letter, you have
wondered in your thoughts at our fixing at Florence instead
of Rome, and without seeing more of Italy before the finality
of making a choice. But observe, Florence is wonderfully
cheap, one lives here for just nothing; and the convenience
in respect to England, letters, and the facility of letting our
house in our absence, is incomparable altogether. At
Rome a house would be habitable only half the year, and the
distance and the expense are objections at the first sight of
the subject.... Altogether, if I could but get a supply of
French books, turning the cock easily, it would be perfect;
but as to <i>anything</i> new in the book way, Vieusseux seems
to have made a vow against it, and poor Robert comes and
goes in a state of desperation between me and the bookseller
('But what <i>can</i> I do, Ba?'), and only brings news of
some pitiful revolution or other which promises a full flush
of republican virtues and falls off into the fleur de lis as
usual. Think of our not having read 'Lucretia' yet&mdash;George
Sand's. And Balzac is six or seven works deep from
us; but these are evils to be borne. We live on just in the
same way, having very few visitors, and receiving them in
the quietest of hospitalities. Mr. Ware, the American, who
wrote the 'Letters from Palmyra,' and is a delightful,
earnest, simple person, comes to have coffee with us once
or twice a week, and very much we like him. Mr. Hillard,
another cultivated American friend of ours, you have in
London, and we should gladly have kept longer. Mr.
Powers does not spend himself much upon visiting, which
is quite right, but we do hope to see a good deal of
Mademoiselle de Fauveau. Robert exceedingly admires her.
As to Italian society, one may as well take to longing for
the evening star, for it seems quite as inaccessible; and
indeed, of society of any sort, we have not much, nor wish
for it, nor miss it. Dearest friend, if I could open my heart
to you in all seriousness, you would see nothing there but a
sort of enduring wonder of happiness&mdash;yes, and some gratitude,
I do hope, besides. Could everything be well in
England, I should only have to melt out of the body at
once in the joy and the glow of it. Happier and happier I
have been, month after month; and when I hear <i>him</i> talk
of being happy too, my very soul seems to swim round with
feelings which cannot be spoken. But I tell you a little,
because I owe the telling to you, and also that you may set
down in your philosophy the possibility of book-making
creatures living happily together. I admit, though, to
begin (or end), that my husband is an exceptional human
being, and that it wouldn't be just to measure another by
him. We are planning a great deal of enjoyment in this
'going to the fair' at Sinigaglia, meaning to go by Arezzo
and San Sepolchro, and Urbino, to Fano, where we shall
pitch our tent for the benefit, as Robert says, of the sea air
and the oysters. Fano is very habitable, and we may get
to Pesaro and the footsteps of Castiglione's 'courtier,' to say
nothing of Bernardo Tasso; and Ancona beckons from the
other side of Sinigaglia, and Loreto beside, only we shall
have to restrain our flights a little. The passage of the
Apennine is said to be magnificent, and, altogether, surely
it must be delightful; and we take only two carpet bags&mdash;not
to be weighed down by 'impedimenta,' and have our
own home, left in charge of the porter, to return to at last,
I am very well and shall be better for the change, though
Robert is dreadfully afraid, as usual, that I shall fall to pieces
at the first motion....</p>

<p>May God bless you!<br />
Ever I am your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>Write to Florence as usual&mdash;Poste Restante. You will
hear how we are in great hopes of dear Mr. Kenyon.</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Nina,&mdash;Only a word in all the hurry of setting
off. We love you as you love us, and are pretty nearly as
happy as you would have us. All love and prosperity to
dear Geddie, too; what do you say of 'Landor,' and my
not sending it to Forster or somebody? <i>Che che</i> (as the
Tuscans exclaim), <i>who</i> was it promised to call at my people's,
who would have tendered it forthwith? I will see about it as
it is. Goodbye, dearest aunt, and let no revolution disturb
your good will to Ba and</p>

<p>R.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: August 24, 1848.<br />

<p>Ever dearest Miss Mitford,&mdash;It's great comfort to have
your letter; for as it came more lingeringly than usual, I
had time to be a little anxious, and even my husband has
confessed since that he thought what he would not say
aloud for fear of paining me, as to the probability of your
being less well than usual. Your letters come so regularly
to the hour, you see, that when it strikes without them, we
ask why. Thank God, you are better after all, and reviving
in spirits, as I saw at the first glance before the words said
it clearly....</p>

<p>As for ourselves, we have scarcely done so well, yet
well; having enjoyed a great deal in spite of drawbacks.
Murray, the traitor, sent us to Fano as a 'delightful summer
residence for an English family,' and we found it uninhabitable
from the heat, vegetation scorched with paleness,
the very air swooning in the sun, and the gloomy looks of
the inhabitants sufficiently corroborative of their words, that
no drop of rain or dew ever falls there during the summer.
A 'circulating library' 'which doesn't give out books,' and
'a refined and intellectual Italian society' (I quote Murray for
that phrase) which 'never reads a book through' (I quote
Mrs. Wiseman, Dr. Wiseman's mother, who has lived in
Fano seven years), complete the advantages of the place,
yet the churches are beautiful, and a divine picture of
Guercino's is worth going all that way to see.<a name="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> By a happy</p>

<p>accident we fell in with Mrs. Wiseman, who, having married
her daughter to Count Gabrielli with ancestral possessions
in Fano, has lived on there from year to year, in a state of
permanent moaning as far as I could apprehend. She is a
very intelligent and vivacious person, and having been used
to the best French society, bears but ill this exile from the
common civilities of life. I wish Dr. Wiseman, of whose
childhood and manhood she spoke with touching pride,
would ask her to minister to the domestic rites of his
bishop's palace in Westminster; there would be no hesitation,
I fancy, in her acceptance of the invitation. Agreeable as
she and her daughter were, however, we fled from Fano
after three days, and, finding ourselves cheated out of our
dream of summer coolness, resolved on substituting for it
what the Italians call 'un bel giro.' So we went to Ancona,
a striking sea city, holding up against the brown rocks and
elbowing out the purple tides, beautiful to look upon. An
exfoliation of the rock itself, you would call the houses that
seem to grow there, so identical is the colour and character.
I should like to visit Ancona again when there is a little air
and shadow; we stayed a week as it was, living upon fish
and cold water. Water, water, was the cry all day long, and
really you should have seen me (or you should not have
seen me) lying on the sofa, and demoralised out of all sense
of female vanity, not to say decency, with dishevelled hair
at full length, and 'sans gown, sans stays, sans shoes, sans
everything,' except a petticoat and white dressing wrapper.
I said something feebly once about the waiter; but I don't
think I meant it for earnest, for when Robert said, 'Oh, don't
mind, dear,' certainly I didn't mind in the least. People
<i>don't</i>, I suppose, when they are in ovens, or in exhausted
receivers. Never before did I guess what heat was&mdash;that's
sure. We went to Loreto for a day, back through Ancona,
Sinigaglia (oh, I forgot to tell you, there was no fair this
year at Sinigaglia; Italy will be content, I suppose, with
selling her honour), Fano, Pesaro, Rimini to Ravenna,
back again over the Apennines from Forli. A 'bel giro,'
wasn't it? Ravenna, where Robert positively wanted to go
to live once, has itself put an end to those yearnings. The
churches are wonderful: holding an atmosphere of purple
glory, and if one could live just in them, or in Dante's
tomb&mdash;well, otherwise keep me from Ravenna. The very
antiquity of the houses is whitewashed, and the marshes on
all sides send up stenches new and old, till the hot air is
sick with them. To get to the pine forest, which is exquisite,
you have to go a mile along the canal, the exhalations
pursuing you step for step, and, what ruffled me more than all
beside, we were not admitted into the house of Dante's tomb
'without an especial permission from the authorities.'
Quite furious I was about this, and both of us too angry to
think of applying: but we stood at the grated window and
read the pathetic inscription as plainly as if we had touched
the marble. We stood there between three and four in the
morning, and then went straight on to Florence from that
tomb of the exiled poet. Just what we should have done,
had the circumstances been arranged in a dramatic intention.
From Forli, the air grew pure and quick again; and the
exquisite, almost visionary scenery of the Apennines, the
wonderful variety of shape and colour, the sudden transitions
and vital individuality of those mountains, the chestnut
forests dropping by their own weight into the deep ravines,
the rocks cloven and clawed by the living torrents, and the
hills, hill above hill, piling up their grand existences as if
they did it themselves, changing colour in the effort&mdash;of these
things I cannot give you any idea, and if words could not,
painting could not either. Indeed, the whole scenery of
our journey, except when we approached the coast, was full
of beauty. The first time we crossed the Apennine (near
Borgo San Sepolcro) we did it by moonlight, and the flesh
was weak, and one fell asleep, and saw things between sleep
and wake, only the effects were grand and singular so, even
though of course we lost much in the distinctness. Well,
but you will understand from all this that we were delighted
to get home&mdash;<i>I</i> was, I assure you. Florence seemed as
cool as an oven after the fire; indeed, we called it quite cool,
and I took possession of my own chair and put up my feet
on the cushions and was charmed, both with having been
so far and coming back so soon. Three weeks brought us
home. Flush was a fellow traveller of course, and enjoyed
it in the most obviously amusing manner. Never was there
so good a dog in a carriage before his time! Think of
Flush, too! He has a supreme contempt for trees and hills
or anything of that kind, and, in the intervals of natural
scenery, he drew in his head from the window and didn't
consider it worth looking at; but when the population
thickened, and when a village or a town was to be passed
through, then his eyes were starting out of his head with
eagerness; he looked east, he looked west, you would
conclude that he was taking notes or preparing them. His
eagerness to get into the carriage first used to amuse the
Italians. Ah, poor Italy! I am as mortified as an Italian
ought to be. They have only the rhetoric of patriots and
soldiers, I fear! Tuscany is to be spared forsooth, if she
lies still, and here she lies, eating ices and keeping the
feast of the Madonna. Perdoni! but she has a review in the
Cascine besides, and a gallant show of some 'ten thousand
men' they are said to have made of it&mdash;only don't think
that I and Robert went out to see that sight. We should
have sickened at it too much. An amiable, refined people,
too, these Tuscans are, conciliating and affectionate. When
you look out into the streets on feast days, you would take
it for one great 'rout,' everybody appears dressed for a
drawing room, and you can scarcely discern the least
difference between class and class, from the Grand Duchess
to the Donna di facenda; also there is no belying of the
costume in the manners, the most gracious and graceful
courtesy and gentleness being apparent in the thickest
crowds. This is all attractive and delightful; but the
people wants <i>stamina</i>, wants conscience, wants self-reverence.
Dante's soul has died out of the land. Enough of this.
As for France, I have 'despaired of the republic' for very
long, but the nation is a great nation, and will right itself
under some flag, white or red. Don't you think so? Thank
you for the news of our authors, it is as 'the sound of a
trumpet afar off,' and I am like the war-horse. Neglectful
that I am, I forgot to tell you before that you heard quite
rightly about Mr. Thackeray's wife, who is ill <i>so</i>. Since
your question, I had in gossip from England that the book
'Jane Eyre' was written by a governess in his house, and
that the preface to the foreign edition refers to him in some
marked way. We have not seen the book at all. But the
first letter in which you mentioned your Oxford student
caught us in the midst of his work upon art.<a name="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> Very vivid,
very graphic, full of sensibility, but inconsequent in some of
the reasoning, it seemed to me, and rather flashy than full
in the metaphysics. Robert, who knows a good deal about
art, to which knowledge I of course have no pretence,
could agree with him only by snatches, and we, both of us,
standing before a very expressive picture of Domenichino's
(the 'David'&mdash;at Fano) wondered how he could blaspheme
so against a great artist. Still, he is no ordinary man, and
for a critic to be so much a poet is a great thing. Also, we
have by no means, I should imagine, seen the utmost of his
stature. How kindly you speak to me of my dearest sisters.
Yes, go to see them whenever you are in London, they are
worthy of the gladness of receiving you. And will you
write soon to me, and tell me everything of yourself, how
you are, how home agrees with you, and the little details
which are such gold dust to absent friends....</p>

<p>May God bless you, my beloved friend. Let me ever
be (my husband joining in all warm regards) your most
affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: October 10, 1848.<br />

<p>My ever dearest Miss Mitford,&mdash;Have you not thought
some hard thoughts of me, for not instantly replying to a
letter which necessarily must have been, to one who loved you,
of such painful interest? Do I not love you truly? Yes, indeed.
But while preparing to write to you my deep regret
at hearing that you had been so ill, illness came in another
form to prevent me from writing, my husband being laid up
for nearly a month with fever and ulcerated sore throat. I
had not the heart to write a line to anyone, much less to
prepare a packet to escort your letter free from foreign
postage; and to make you pay for a chapter of Lamentations'
without the spirit of prophecy, would have been too hard on
you, wouldn't it? Quite unhappy I have been over those
burning hands and languid eyes, the only unhappiness I
ever had by <i>them</i>, and then he wouldn't see a physician; and
if it hadn't been that, just at the right moment, Mr. Mahony,
the celebrated Jesuit, and Father Prout of 'Fraser,' knowing
everything as those Jesuits are apt to do, came in to us on
his way to Rome, pointed out that the fever got ahead
through weakness and mixed up with his own kind hand a
potion of eggs and port wine, to the horror of our Italian
servant, who lifted up his eyes at such a prescription
for a fever, crying, 'O Inglesi, Inglesi!' the case would have
been far worse, I have no kind of doubt. For the eccentric
prescription gave the power of sleeping, and the pulse grew
quieter directly. I shall always be grateful to Father Prout,
always. The very sight of some one with a friend's name
and a cheerful face, his very jests at me for being a 'bambina'
and frightened without cause, were as comforting as the
salutation of angels. Also, he has been in Florence ever
since, and we have seen him every day; he came to doctor
and remained to talk. A very singular person, of whom the
world tells a thousand and one tales, you know, but of whom
I shall speak as I find him, because the utmost kindness
and warmheartedness have characterised his whole bearing
towards us. Robert met him years ago at dinner at Emerson
Tennent's, and since has crossed paths with him on various
points of Europe. The first time I saw him was as he
stood on a rock at Leghorn, at our disembarkation in Italy.
Not refined in a social sense by any manner of means, yet
a most accomplished scholar and vibrating all over with
learned associations and vivid combinations of fancy and
experience&mdash;having seen all the ends of the earth and the
men thereof, and possessing the art of talk and quotation to
an amusing degree. In another week or two he will be at
Rome.... How graphically you give us your Oxford
student! Well! the picture is more distinct than Turner's,
and if you had called it, in the manner of the Master, 'A
Rock Limpet,' we should have recognised in it the corresponding
type of the gifted and eccentric writer in question.
Very eloquent he is, I agree at once, and true views he takes
of Art in the abstract, true and elevating. It is in the
application of connective logic that he breaks away from one so
violently.... We are expecting our books by an early
vessel, and are about to be very busy, building up a rococo
bookcase of carved angels and demons. Also we shall get
up curtains, and get down bedroom carpets, and finish the
remainder of our furnishing business, now that the hot
weather is at an end. I say 'at an end,' though the glass
stands at seventy. As to the 'war,' <i>that</i> is rather different,
it is painful to feel ourselves growing gradually cooler and
cooler on the subject of Italian patriotism, valour, and good
sense; but the process is inevitable. The child's play
between the Livornese and our Grand Duke provokes a
thousand pleasantries. Every now and then a day is fixed
for a revolution in Tuscany, but up to the present time a
shower has come and put it off. Two Sundays ago
Florence was to have been 'sacked' by Leghorn, when a
drizzle came and saved us. You think this a bad joke of
mine or an impotent sarcasm, perhaps; whereas I merely
speak historically. Brave men, good men, even sensible men
there are of course in the land, but they are not strong
enough for the times or for masterdom. For France, it is a
great nation; but even in France they want a man, and
Cavaignacso<a name="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> only a soldier. If Louis Napoleon had the
muscle of his uncle's little finger in his soul, he would be
president, and king; but he is flaccid altogether, you see,
and Joinville stands nearer to the royal probability after all.
'Henri Cinq' is said to be too closely espoused to the
Church, and his connections at Naples and Parma don't help
his cause. Robert has more hope of the <i>republic</i> than I
have: but call ye <i>this</i> a republic? Do you know that
Miss Martineau takes up the 'History of England' under
Charles Knight, in the continuation of a popular book?
I regret her fine imagination being so wasted. So you saw
Mr. Chorley? What a pleasant flashing in the eyes! We
hear of him in Holland and Norway. Dear Mr. Kenyon
won't stir from England, we see plainly. Ah! Frederic
Souli&eacute;! he is too dead, I fear. Perhaps he goes on, though,
writing romances, after the fashion of poor Miss Pickering,
that prove nothing. I long for my French fountains of
living literature, which, pure or impure, plashed in one's
face so pleasantly. Some old French 'M&eacute;moires' we have
got at lately, 'Brienne' for instance. It is curious how the
leaders of the last revolution (under Louis XVIII.) seem to
have despised one another. Brienne is very dull and flat.
For Puseyism, it runs counter to the spirit of our times,
after all, and will never achieve a church. May God bless
you! Robert's regards go with the love of your ever
affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: December 3, 1848.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;It seemed long to me that
you had not written, and it seems long to me now that
I have not answered the kind letter which came at
last. Then Henrietta told me of your being unwell at
the moment of her mad excursion into Herefordshire.
Altogether I want to speak to you and hear from you, and
shall be easier and gladder when both are done. Do
forgive my sins and write directly, and tell me everything
about both of you, and how you are in spirits and health,
and whether you really make up your minds to see more
danger in the stormy influences of the Continent in the
moral point of view than in those of England in the
physical. For my part I hold to my original class of fear,
and would rather face two or three revolutions than an east
wind of an English winter. If I were you I would go to Pau
as usual and take poor Abd-el-Kader's place (my husband is
furious about the treatment of Abd-el-Kader, so I hear a
good deal about him<a name="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>), or I would go to Italy and try</p>

<p>Florence, where really democratic ministries roar as gently
as sucking doves, particularly when they are safe in place.
We have listened to dreadful rumours&mdash;Florence was to
have been sacked several times by the Livornese; the
Grand Duke went so far as to send away his family to
Siena, and we had 'Morte a Fiorentini!' chalked up on the
walls. Still, somehow or other, the peace has been kept in
Florentine fashion; it has rained once or twice, which is
always enough here to moderate the most revolutionary
when they wear their best surtouts, and I look forward to
an unbroken tranquillity just as I used to do, even though
the windows of the Ridolfi Palace (the ambassador in
London) were smashed the other evening a few yards from
ours. Perhaps a gentle and affectionate approach to
contempt for our Florentines mixes a little with this feeling
of security, but what then? They are an amiable, refined,
graceful people, with much of the artistic temperament as
distinguished from that of men of genius&mdash;effeminate, no,
rather <i>feminine</i> in a better sense&mdash;of a fancy easily turned
into impulse, but with no strenuous and determinate
strength in them. What they comprehend best in the
'Italian League' is probably a league to wear silk velvet
and each a feather in his hat, to carry flags and cry <i>vivas</i>,
and keep a grand festa day in the piazzas. Better and
happier in this than in stabbing prime ministers, or hanging
up their dead bodies to shoot at; and not much more
childish than these French patriots and republicans, who
crown their great deeds by electing to the presidency such
a man as Prince Louis Napoleon, simply because 'C'est le
neveu de son oncle!'<a name="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> A curious precedent for a president,
certainly; but, oh heavens and earth, what curious
things abroad everywhere just now, inclusive of the sea
serpent! I agree with you that much of all is very melancholy
and disheartening, though holding fast by my hope and
belief that good will be the end, as it always <i>is</i> God's
end to man's frenzies, and that all we observe is but the
fermentation necessary to the new wine, which presently we
shall drink pure. Meanwhile, the saddest thing is the
impossibility (which I, for one, feel) to sympathise, to go
along with, the <i>people</i> to whom and to whose cause all my
natural sympathies yearn. The word 'Liberty' ceases to
make me thrill, as at something great and unmistakable,
as, for instance, the other great words Truth, and Justice;
do. The salt has lost its savour, the meaning has escaped
from the term; we know nothing of what people will <i>do</i>
when they aspire to Liberty. The holiness of liberty is
desecrated by the sign of the ass's hoof. Fixed principles,
either of opinion or action, seem clearly gone out of the
world. The principle of Destruction is in the place of the
principle of Re-integration, or of Radical Reform, as we
called it in England. I look all round and can sympathise
nowhere. The rulers hold by rottenness, and the people
leap into the abyss, and nobody knows why this is, or why
that is. As to France, my tears (which I really couldn't
help at the time of the expulsion of poor Louis Philippe
and his family, not being very strong just then) are justified,
it appears, though my husband thought them foolish (and so
did I), and though we both began by an adhesion to the
Republic in the cordial manner. But, just see, the Republic
was a 'man in an iron mask' or helmet, and turns out a
military dictatorship, a throttling of the press, a starving of
the finances, and an election of Louis Napoleon to be
President. Louis Philippe was better than all this, take
him at worst, and at worst he did <i>not</i> deserve the mud and
stones cast at him, which I have always maintained and
maintain still. England might have got up ('happy
country') more crying grievances than France at the
moment of outbreak; but what makes outbreaks now-a-days
is not 'the cause, my soul,' but the stuff of the people.
You are huckaback on the other side of the Channel, and
you wear out the poor Irish linen, let the justice of the case
be what it may. Politics enough and too much, surely,
especially now when they are depressing to you, and more
or less to everybody.... We are still in the slow agonies
of furnishing our apartment. You see, being the poorest
and most prudent of possible poets, we had to solve the
problem of taking our furniture out of our year's income
(proceeds of poems and the like), and of not getting into
debt. Oh, I take no credit to myself; I was always in
debt in my little way ('small <i>im</i> morals,' as Dr. Bowring
might call it) before I married, but Robert, though a poet
and dramatist by profession, being descended from the
blood of all the Puritans, and educated by the strictest of
dissenters, has a sort of horror about the dreadful fact of
owing five shillings five days, which I call quite morbid in
its degree and extent, and which is altogether unpoetical
according to the traditions of the world. So we have been
dragging in by inches our chairs and tables throughout the
summer, and by no means look finished and furnished at
this late moment, the slow Italians coming at the heels of
our slowest intentions with the putting up of our curtains,
which begin to be necessary in this November tramontana.
Yet in a month or three weeks we shall look quite
comfortable&mdash;before Christmas; and in the meantime we heap
up the pine wood and feel perfectly warm with these thick
palace walls between us and the outside air. Also my
husband's new edition is on the <i>edge</i> of coming out, and we
have had an application from Mr. Phelps, of Sadler's Wells,
for leave to act his 'Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' which, if it
doesn't succeed, its public can have neither hearts nor
intellects (that being an impartial opinion), and which, if it
succeeds, will be of pecuniary advantage to us. Look out
in the papers.... My love and my husband's go to you,
our dear friends. Let me be always</p>

<p>Your affectionate and grateful<br />
BA.</p>

<p>While Italy shows herself so politically demoralised,
and the blood of poor Russia smokes from the ground, the
ground seems to care no more for it than the newspapers,

White roses, as in June.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: December 16, [1848].<br />

<p>... You are wondering, perhaps, how we are so fool-hardy
as to keep on furnishing rooms in the midst of
'anarchy,' the Pope a fugitive, and the crowned heads
packing up. Ah, but we have faith in the <i>softness</i> of our
Florentines, who must be well spurred up to the leap
before they do any harm. These things look worse at a
distance than they do near, although, seen far and near,
nothing <i>can</i> be worse than the evidence of demoralisation
of people, governors, and journalists, in the sympathy given
everywhere to the assassination of poor Rossi.<a name="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> If Rossi</p>

<p>was retrocessive, he was at least a constitutional minister,
and constitutional means of opposing him were open to all,
but Italy understands nothing constitutional; liberty is a
fair word and a watchword, nothing more; an idea it is
not in the minds of any. The poor Pope I deeply pity;
he is a weak man with the noblest and most disinterested
intentions. His faithful flock have nearly broken his heart
by the murder of his two personal friends, Rossi and
Palma, and the threat, which they sent him by embassy, of
murdering every man, woman, and child in the Quirinal,
with the exception of his Holiness, unless he accepted
their terms. He should have gone out to them and so
died, but having missed that opportunity, nothing remained
but flight. He was a mere Pope hostage as long as he
stayed in Rome. Curious, the 'intervention of the French,'
so long desired by the Italians, and vouchsafed <i>so</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> The
Florentines open their eyes in mute astonishment, and
some of them 'won't read the journals any more.' The
boldest say softly that the <i>Romans are sure not to bear it</i>.
And what is to happen in France? Why, what a world we
have just now.... Father Prout is gone to Rome for a
fortnight, has stayed three weeks, and day by day we
expect him back again. I don't understand how the Prout
papers should have hurt him ecclesiastically, but that he
should be <i>known</i> for their writer is not astonishing, as the
secret was never, I believe, attempted to be kept. We
have been, at least <i>I</i> have been, a little anxious lately
about the fate of the 'Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' which
Mr. Phelps applied for my husband's permission to revive
at Sadler's. Of course, putting the request was a mere
form, as he had every right to act the play, and there was
nothing to answer but one thing. Only it made one
anxious&mdash;made <i>me</i> anxious&mdash;till we heard the result, and
we, both of us, are very grateful to dear Mr. Chorley, who
not only made it his business to be at the theatre the first
night, but, before he slept, sat down like a true friend to
give us the story of the result, and never, he says, was a
more complete and legitimate success. The play went
straight to the heart of the audience, it seems, and we hear
of its continuance on the stage from the papers. So far, so
well. You may remember, or may not have heard, how
Macready brought it out and put his foot on it in the flash
of a quarrel between manager and author, and Phelps,
knowing the whole secret and feeling the power of the play,
determined on making a revival of it on his own theatre,
which was wise, as the event proves. Mr. Chorley called
his acting really 'fine.' I see the second edition of the
'Poetical Works' advertised at last in the 'Athenaeum,' and
conclude it to be coming out directly. Also my second edition
is called for, only nothing is yet arranged on that point.
We have had a most interesting letter from Mr. Home,
giving terrible accounts, to be sure, of the submersion of all
literature in England and France since the French Revolution,
but noble and instructive proof of individual wave-riding
energy, such as I have always admired in him. He
and his wife, he says, live chiefly on the produce of their
garden, and keep a cheerful heart for the rest; even the
'Institutes' expect gratuitous lectures, so that the sweat of
the brain seems less productive than the sweat of the brow.
I am glad that Mr. Serjeant Talfourd and his wife spoke
affectionately of my husband, for he is attached to both of
them.... My Flush has grown to be passionately fond of
grapes, devouring bunch after bunch, and looking so fat
and well that we attribute some virtue to them. When he
goes to England he will be as much in a strait as an
Italian who related to us his adventures in London; he
had had a long walk in the heat, and catching sight of
grapes hanging up in a grocer's shop, he stopped short to
have a pennyworth, as he said inwardly to himself. Down
he sat and made out a Tuscan luncheon in purple bunches.
At last, taking out his purse to look for the halfpence:
'Fifteen shillings, sir, if you please,' said the shopman.
Now do write soon, and speak particularly of your health,
and take care of it and don't be too complaisant to visitors.
May God bless you, my very dear friend! Think of me as</p>

<p>Ever your affectionate and grateful<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />
<p>There is here a pause of two months in the correspondence
of Mrs. Browning, during which the happiness of
her already happy life was crowned by the birth, on
March 9, 1849, of her son, Robert Wiedeman Barrett
Browning.<a name="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> How great a part this child henceforward
played in her life will be shown abundantly by the
letters that follow. Some passages referring to the child's
growth, progress, and performances have been omitted,
partly in the necessary reduction of the bulk of the
correspondence, and partly because too much of one subject
may weary the reader. But enough has been left to show
that, in the case of Mrs. Browning (and of her husband
likewise), the parent was by no means lost in the poet.
There is little in what she says which might not equally be
said, and is in substance said, by hundreds of happy mothers
in every age; but it would be a suppression of one essential
part of her nature, and an injury to the pleasant picture
which the whole life of this poet pair presents, if her
enthusiasms over her child were omitted or seriously
curtailed. Biographers are fond of elaborating the details
in which the lives of poets have not conformed to the
standard of the moral virtues; let us at least recognise
that, in the case of Robert and Elizabeth Browning, the
moral and the intellectual virtues flourished side by side,
each contributing its share to the completeness of the whole
character.</p>

<p>The joy of this firstborn's birth was, however, very
quickly dimmed by the news of the death, only a few days
later, of Mr. Browning's mother, to whom he was devotedly
attached. Her death was very sudden, and the shock of
the reaction completely prostrated him for a long time.
The following letters from Mrs. Browning tell how he felt
this loss.</p>
<br />
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
April 1, 1849 [postmark].<br />

<p>I do indeed from the bottom of my heart pity you and
grieve with you, my dearest Sarianna. I may grieve with
you as well as for you; for I too have lost. Believe that,
though I never saw her face; I loved that pure and tender
spirit (tender to me even at this distance), and that she will
be dear and sacred to me to the end of my own life.</p>

<p>Dearest Sarianna, I thank you for your consideration
and admirable self-control in writing those letters. I do
thank and bless you. If the news had come unbroken by
such precaution to my poor darling Robert, it would have
nearly killed him, I think. As it is, he has been able to
cry from the first, and I am able to tell you that though
dreadfully affected, of course, for you know his passionate
love for her, he is better and calmer now&mdash;much better.
He and I dwell on the hope that you and your dear father
will come to us at once. Come&mdash;dear, dear Sarianna&mdash;I
will at least love you as you deserve&mdash;you and him&mdash;if
I can do no more. If you would comfort Robert, come.</p>

<p>No day has passed since our marriage that he has not
fondly talked of her. I know how deep in his dear heart
her memory lies. God comfort you, my dearest Sarianna.
The blessing of blessed duties heroically fulfilled <i>must</i> be
With you. May the blessing of the Blessed in heaven be
added to the rest!</p>

<p>Robert stops me. My dear love to your father.</p>

<p>Your ever attached sister,
BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
[April 1849.]<br />

<p>You will have comfort in hearing, my dearest Sarianna,
that Robert is better on the whole than when I wrote last,
though still very much depressed. I wish I could get him
to go somewhere or do something&mdash;at any rate God's
comforts are falling like dew on all this affliction, and must
in time make it look a green memory to you both. Continually
he thinks of you and of his father&mdash;believe how
continually and tenderly he thinks of you. Dearest
Sarianna, I feel so in the quick of my heart how you must
feel, that I scarcely have courage to entreat you to go out
and take the necessary air and exercise, and yet that is a
duty, clear as other duties, and to be discharged like others
by you, as fully, and with as little shrinking of the will. If
your health should suffer, what grief upon grief to those
who grieve already! And besides, we who have to live
are not to lie down under the burden. There will be time
enough for lying down presently, very soon; and in the
meanwhile there is plenty of God's work to do with the
body and with the soul, and we have to do it as cheerfully
as we can. Dearest Sarianna, you can look behind and
before, on blessed memories and holy hopes&mdash;love is as
full for you as ever in the old relation, even though her
life in the world is cut off. There is no drop of bitterness
in all this flood of sorrow. In the midst of the great
anguish which God has given, you have to thank Him
for some blessing with every pang as it comes. Never was
a more beautiful, serene, assuring death than this we are
all in tears for&mdash;for, believe me, my very dear sister, I
have mourned with you, knowing what we all have lost,
I who never saw her nor shall see her until a few years
shall bring us all together to the place where none mourn
nor are parted. Sarianna, will it not be possible, do you
think, for you and your father to come here, if only for a
few months? Then you might decide on the future upon
more knowledge than you have now. It would be comfort
and joy to Robert and me if we could all of us live together
henceforward. Think what you would like, and how you
would best like it. Your living on <i>even through this summer
at that house</i>, I, who have well known the agony of such
bindings to the rack, do protest against. Dearest Sarianna,
it is not good or right either for you or for your dear father.
For Robert to go back to that house unless it were to do one
of you some good, think how it would be with <i>him</i>! Tell us
now (for he yearns towards you&mdash;we both do), what is the
best way of bringing us all together, so as to do every one of
us some good? If Florence is too far off, is there any other
place where we could meet and arrange for the future?
Could not your dear father's leave of absence be extended
this summer, out of consideration of what has happened,
and would he not be so enabled to travel with you and
meet us <i>somewhere</i>? We will do anything. For my part,
I am full of anxiety; and for Robert, you may guess what
his is, you who know him. Very bitter has it been to me
to have interposed unconsciously as I have done and
deprived him of her last words and kisses&mdash;very bitter&mdash;and
nothing could be so consolatory to me as to give him
back to <i>you</i> at least. So think for me, dearest Sarianna&mdash;think
for your father and yourself, think for Robert&mdash;and
remember that Robert and I will do anything which shall
appear possible to you. May God bless you, both of you!
Give my true love to your father. Feeling for you and with
you always and most tenderly, I am your affectionate sister,
BA.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: April 30, 1849.<br />

<p>I am writing to you, <i>at last</i>, you will say, ever dearest
Miss Mitford; but, except once to Wimpole Street, this is
the first packet of letters which goes from me since my
confinement. You will have heard how our joy turned
suddenly into deep sorrow by the death of my husband's
mother. An unsuspected disease (ossification of the heart)
terminated in a fatal way, and she lay in the insensibility
precursive of the grave's, when the letter, written in such
gladness by my poor husband, and announcing the birth of
his child, reached her address. 'It would have made her
heart bound,' said her daughter to us. Poor, tender heart,
the last throb was too near. The medical men would not
allow the news to be communicated. The next joy she
felt was to be in heaven itself. My husband has been in
the deepest anguish, and indeed, except for the courageous
consideration of his sister, who wrote two letters of preparation
saying that 'she was not well,' and she 'was very ill,'
when in fact all was over, I am frightened to think what the
result would have been to him. He has loved his mother
as such passionate natures only can love, and I never saw a
man so bowed down in an extremity of sorrow&mdash;never.
Even now the depression is great, and sometimes when I
leave him alone a little and return to the room, I find him
in tears. I do earnestly wish to change the scene and air;
but where to go? England looks terrible now. He says it
would break his heart to see his mother's roses over the
wall, and the place where she used to lay her scissors and
gloves. Which I understand so thoroughly that I can't say,
'Let us go to England.' We must wait and see what his
father and sister will choose to do or choose us to do, for of
course a duty plainly seen would draw us anywhere. My
own dearest sisters will be painfully disappointed by any
change of plan, only they are too good and kind not to
understand the difficulty, not to see the motive. So do
<i>you</i>, I am certain. It has been very very painful altogether,
this drawing together of life and death. Robert was too
enraptured at my safety, and with his little son, and the
sudden reaction was terrible. You see how natural that
was. How kind of you to write that note to him full of
affectionate expressions towards me! Thank you, dearest
friend. He had begged my sisters to let you know of my
welfare, and I hope they did; and now it is my turn to know
of <i>you</i>, and so I do entreat you not to delay, but to let me
hear exactly how you are and what your plans are for the
summer. Do you think of Paris seriously? Am I not a
sceptic about your voyages round the world? It's about
the only thing that I don't thoroughly believe you <i>can</i> do.
But (not to be impertinent) I want to hear so much! I
want first and chiefly to hear of your health; and occupations
next, and next your plans for the summer. Louis
Napoleon is astonishing the world, you see, by his firmness
and courage; and though really I don't make out the aim
and end of his French republicans in going to Rome to
extinguish the republic there, I wait before I swear at him
for it till my information becomes fuller. If they have at
Rome such a republic as we have had in Florence, without
a public, imposed by a few bawlers and brawlers on many
mutes and cowards, why, the sooner it goes to pieces the
better, of course. Probably the French Government acts
upon information. In any case, if the Romans are in earnest
they may resist eight thousand men. We shall see. My
<i>faith</i> in every species of Italian is, however, nearly tired out.
I don't believe they are men at all, much less heroes and
patriots. Since I wrote last to you, I think we have had
two revolutions here at Florence, Grand Duke out, Grand
Duke in.<a name="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> The bells in the church opposite rang for both.
They first planted a tree of liberty close to our door, and,
then they pulled it down. The same tune, sung under the
windows, did for 'Viva la republica!' and 'Viva Leopoldo!'
The genuine popular feeling is certainly for the Grand Duke
('O, santissima madre di Dio!' said our nurse, clasping her
hands, 'how the people do love him!'); only nobody would
run the risk of a pin's prick to save the ducal throne. If
the Leghornese, who put up Guerazzi on its ruins, had not
refused to pay at certain Florentine caf&eacute;s, we shouldn't have
had revolution the second, and all this shooting in the
street! Dr. Harding, who was coming to see me, had time
to get behind a stable door, just before there was a fall
against it of four shot corpses; and Robert barely managed
to get home across the bridges. He had been out walking
in the city, apprehending nothing, when the storm gathered
and broke. Sad and humiliating it all has been, and the
author of 'Vanity Fair' might turn it to better uses for a
chapter. By the way, we have just been reading 'Vanity
Fair.' Very clever, very effective, but cruel to human
nature. A painful book, and not the pain that purifies and
exalts. Partial truths after all, and those not wholesome.
But I certainly had no idea that Mr. Thackeray had
intellectual force for such a book; the power is considerable.
For Balzac, Balzac may have gone out of the world as far as
we are concerned. Isn't it hard on us? exiles from Balzac!
The bookseller here, having despaired of the republic and
the Grand Duchy both, I suppose, and taking for granted
on the whole that the world must be coming shortly to an
end, doesn't give us the sign of a new book. We ought to,
be done with such vanities. There! and almost I have
done my paper without a single word to you of the <i>baby</i>!
Ah, you won't believe that I forgot him even if I pretend,
so I won't. He is a lovely, fat, strong child, with double
chins and rosy cheeks, and a great wide chest, undeniable
lungs, I can assure you. Dr. Harding called him 'a robust
child' the other day, and 'a more beautiful child he never
saw.' I never saw a child half as beautiful, for my part....
Dear Mr. Chorley has written the kindest letter to my
husband. I much regard him indeed. May God bless
you. Let me ever be (with Robert's thanks and warm
remembrance)</p>

<p>Your most affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>Flush's jealousy of the baby would amuse you. For a
whole fortnight he fell into deep melancholy and was proof
against all attentions lavished on him. Now he begins to
be consoled a little and even condescends to patronise the
cradle.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
[Florence:] May 2, 1849.<br />

<p>Robert gives me this blank, and three minutes to write
across it. Thank you, my very dear Sarianna, for all your
kindness and affection. I understand what I have lost. I
know the worth of a tenderness such as you speak of,
and I feel that for the sake of my love for Robert she was
ready out of the fullness of her heart to love <i>me</i> also. It
has been bitter to me that I have unconsciously deprived
him of the personal face-to-face shining out of her angelic
nature for more than two years, but she has forgiven me,
and we shall all meet, when it pleases God, before His
throne. In the meanwhile, my dearest Sarianna, we are
thinking much of you, and neither of us can bear the
thought of your living on where you are. If you could
imagine the relief it would be to us&mdash;to me as well as to
Robert&mdash;to be told frankly what we ought to do, where we
ought to go, to please you best&mdash;you and your dearest
father&mdash;you would think the whole matter over and use
plain words in the speaking of it. Robert naturally shrinks
from the idea of going to New Cross under the circumstances
of dreary change, and for his sake England has
grown suddenly to me a land of clouds. Still, to see you
and his father, and to be some little comfort to you both,
would be the best consolation to him, I am very sure; and
so, dearest Sarianna, think of us and speak to us. Could
not your father get a long vacation? Could we not meet
somewhere? Think how we best may comfort ourselves by
comforting you. Never think of us, Sarianna, as apart
from you&mdash;as if our interest or our pleasure <i>could</i> be apart
from yours. The child is so like Robert that I can believe
in the other likeness, and may the inner nature indeed, as
you say, be after that pure image! He is so fat and rosy
and strong that almost I am sceptical of his being my child.
I suppose he is, after all. May God bless you, both of you.
I am ashamed to send all these letters, but Robert makes
me. He is better, but still much depressed sometimes, and
over your letters he drops heavy tears. Then he treasures
them up and reads them again and again. Better, however,
on the whole, he is certainly. Poor little babe, who was too
much rejoiced over at <i>first</i>, fell away by a most natural
recoil (even <i>I</i> felt it to be <i>most natural</i>) from all that
triumph, but Robert is still very fond of him, and goes to
see him bathed every morning, and walks up and down on
the terrace with him in his arms. If your dear father can
toss and rock babies as Robert can, he will be a nurse in
great favour.</p>

<p>Dearest Sarianna, take care of yourself, and do walk
out. No grief in the world was ever freer from the
corroding drop of bitterness&mdash;was ever sweeter, holier, and
more hopeful than this of yours must be. Love is for you
on both sides of the grave, and the blossoms of love meet
over it. May God's love, too, bless you!</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate sister,<br />
BA.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: May 14, [1849].<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;At last I come to thank you
for all your kindness, all your goodness, all your sympathy
for both of us. Robert would have written to you in the
first instance (for we <i>both</i> thought of you) if we had not
agreed that you would hear as quickly from Henrietta, we
not knowing your direct address. Also your welcome little
note should have had an immediate acknowledgment from
him if he had not been so depressed at that time that I was
glad to ask him to wait till I should be ready to write
myself. In fact, he has suffered most acutely from the
affliction you have since of course heard of; and just because
he was <i>too happy</i> when the child was born, the pain was
overwhelming afterwards. That is easy to understand, I
think. While he was full of joy for the child, his mother
was dying at a distance, and the very thought of accepting
that new affection for the old became a thing to recoil
from&mdash;do you not see? So far from suffering less through
the particular combination of circumstances, as some people
seemed to fancy he would, he suffered much more, I am
certain, and very naturally. Even now he is looking very
unwell&mdash;thinner and paler than usual, and his spirits, which
used to be so good, have not rallied. I long to get him
away from Florence somewhere&mdash;<i>where</i>, I can't fix my
wishes; our English plans seem flat on the ground for the
present, <i>that</i> is one sad certainty. My dearest sisters will
be very grieved if we don't go to England, and yet how can
I even try to persuade my husband back into the scene of
old associations where he would feel so much pain? Do I
not know what I myself should suffer in some places?
And he loved his mother with all his power of loving, which
is deeper and more passionate than love is with common
men. She hearts of men are generally strong in proportion
to their heads. Well, I am not to send you such a dull
letter though, after waiting so long, and after receiving so
much to speak thankfully of. My child you never would
believe to be <i>my child</i>, from the evidence of his immense
cheeks and chins&mdash;for pray don't suppose that he has only
one chin. People call him a lovely child, and if <i>I</i> were to
call him the same it wouldn't be very extraordinary, only I
assure you 'a robust child' I may tell you that he is with a
sufficient modesty, and also that Wilson says he is universally
admired in various tongues when she and the nurse go out
with him to the Cascine&mdash;'What a beautiful baby!' and
'Che bel bambino!' He has had a very stormy entrance
upon life, poor little fellow; and when he was just three
days old, a grand festa round the liberty tree planted at our
door, attended with military music, civic dancing and
singing, and the firing of cannons and guns from morning
to night, made him start in his cradle, and threw my careful
nurse into paroxysms of devotion before the 'Vergine
Santissima' that I mightn't have a fever in consequence.
Since then the tree of liberty has come down with a crash
and we have had another festa as noisy on that occasion.
Revolution and counter-revolution, Guerazzi<a name="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> and Leopold,
sacking of Florence and entrance of the Austrian army&mdash;we
live through everything, you see, and baby grows fat
indiscriminately. For my part, I am altogether <i>blas&eacute;e</i> about
revolutions and invasions. Don't think it want of feeling in
me, or want of sympathy with 'the people,' but really I
can't help a certain political latitudinarianism from creeping
over me in relation to this Tuscany. You ought to be here
to understand what I mean and how I think. Oh heavens!
how ignoble it all has been and is! A revolution made by
boys and <i>vivas</i>, and unmade by boys and <i>vivas</i>&mdash;no,
there was blood shed in the unmaking&mdash;some horror and
terror, but not as much patriotism and truth as could lift
up the blood from the kennel. The counter-revolution was
strictly <i>counter</i>, observe. I mean, that if the Leghornese
troops here bad paid their debts at the Florentine coffee
houses, the Florentines would have let their beloved Grand
Duke stay on at Gaeta to the end of the world. The
Grand Duke, too, whose part I have been taking hitherto
(because he did seem to me a good man, more sinned
against than sinning)&mdash;the Grand Duke I give up from
henceforth, seeing that he has done this base thing of
taking again his Austrian titles in his proclamations
coincidently with the approach of the Austrians. Of Rome,
knowing nothing, I don't like to speak. If a republic <i>in
earnest</i> is established there, Louis Napoleon should not try
to set his foot on it. Dearest Mrs. Martin, how you
mistake me about France, and how too lightly I must have
spoken. If you knew how I admire the French as a nation!
Robert always calls them '<i>my beloved French</i>.' Their very
faults appear to me to arise from an excess of ideality
land aspiration; but I was vexed rather at their selection
of Louis Napoleon&mdash;a selection since justified by the
firmness and apparent integrity of the man. His reputation
in England, you will admit, did not promise the conclusion.
Will he be emperor, do you imagine? And shall I ever
have done talking politics? I would far rather talk of <i>you</i>,
after all. Henrietta tells me of your looking well, but of
your not being strong yet. Now do, <i>for once</i>, have a fit of
egotism and tell me a little about yourself.... Surely I ought
especially to thank you, dearest kind friend, for your goodness
in writing to&mdash;, of which Henrietta very properly told
me. I never shall forget this and other proofs of your
affection for me, and shall remember them with warm
gratitude always. As to&mdash;, I have held out both [my]
hands, and my husband's hands in mine, again and again
to him; he cannot possibly, in the secret place of his heart,
expect more from either of us. My husband would have
written to him in the first place, but for the obstacles raised
by himself and others, and now what <i>could</i> Robert write
and say except the bare repetition of what I have said over
and over for him and myself? It is exactly an excuse&mdash;not
more and not less. Just before I was ill I sent my last
messages, because, with certain hazards before me, my
heart turned to them naturally. I might as well have turned
to a rock.&mdash;has been by far the kindest, and has
written to me two or three little notes, and one since the
birth of our child. I love them all far too well to be proud,
and my husband loves me too well not to wish to be friends
with every one of them; we have neither of us any stupid
feeling about 'keeping up our dignity.' Yes, I had a letter
from&mdash;some time ago, in which something was said
of Robert's being careless of reconciliation. I answered
it most explicitly and affectionately, with every possible
assurance from Robert, and offering them from himself the
affection of a brother. Not a word in answer! To my
poor dearest papa I have written very lately, and as my
letter has not, after a week, been sent back, I catch at the
hope of his being moved a little. If he neither sends it
back nor replies severely, I shall take courage to write to
him again after a while. It will be an immense gain to get
him only to read my letters. My father and my brothers
hold quite different positions, of course, and though he has
acted sternly towards me, I, knowing his peculiarities, do
not feel embittered and astonished and disappointed as in
the other cases. Absolutely happy my marriage has been&mdash;never
could there be a happier marriage (as there are no
marriages in heaven); but dear Henrietta is quite wrong in
fancying, or seeming to fancy, that this quarrel with my
family has given or gives me slight pain. Old affections
are not so easily trodden out of me, indeed, and while I
live unreconciled to them, there must be a void and
drawback. Do write to me and tell me of both of you,
my very dear friends. Don't fancy that we are not anxious
for brave Venice and Sicily, and that we don't hate this
Austrian invasion. But Tuscany has acted a vile part
altogether&mdash;<i>so</i> vile, that I am sceptical about the Romans.
We expect daily the Austrians in Florence, and have made
up our minds to be very kind. May God bless you! Do
write, and mention your health particularly, as I am anxious
about it. I am quite well myself, and, as ever,</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>Don't you both like Macaulay's History? We are
delighted just now with it.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
[Florence: about June 1849.]<br />

<p>I must say to my dearest Sarianna how delighted we are
at the thought of seeing her in Florence. I wish it had
been before the autumn, but since autumn is decided for
we must be content to reap our golden harvest at the time
for such things. Certainly the summer heat of Florence is
terrible enough&mdash;only we should have carried you with us
into the shade somewhere to the sea or to the mountains&mdash;and
Robert has, of course, told you of our Spezzia plan.
The 'fatling of the flock' has been sheared closely of his
long petticoats. Did he tell you that? And you can't
think how funny the little creature looks without his train,
his wise baby face appearing to approve of the whole
arrangement. He talks to himself now and smiles at
everybody, and admired my roses so much the other day
that he wanted to eat them; having a sublime transcendental
notion about the mouth being the receptacle of all
beauty and glory in this world. Tell your dear father that
certainly he <i>is</i> a 'sweet baby,' there's no denying it. We
lay him down on the floor to let him kick at ease, and he
makes violent efforts to get up by himself, and Wilson
declares that the least encouragement would set him walking.
Robert's nursing does not mend his spirits much. I
shall be very glad to get him away from Florence; he has
suffered too much here to rally as I long to see him do,
because, dearest Sarianna, we have to live after all; and to
live rightly we must turn our faces forward and press
forward and not look backward morbidly for the footsteps
in the dust of those beloved ones who travelled with us but
yesterday. They themselves are not behind but before,
and we carry with us our tenderness living and undiminished
towards them, to be completed when the round of this life
is complete for us also. Dearest Sarianna, why do I say
such things, but because I have known what grief is? Oh,
and how I could have compounded with you, grief for grief,
mine for yours, for <i>I</i> had no last words nor gestures,
Sarianna. God keep you from such a helpless bitter agony
as mine then was. Dear Sarianna, you will think of us and
of Florence, my dear sister, and remember how you have
made us a promise and have to keep it. May God bless
you and comfort you. We think of you and love you
continually, and I am always your most affectionate</p>

<p>In July the move from Florence, of which Mrs. Browning
speaks in the above letter, was effected, the place ultimately
chosen for escape from the summer heat in the valley of
the Arno being the Bagni di Lucca. Here three months
were spent, as the following letters describe. By this time
the struggle for Italian liberty had ended in failure everywhere.
The battle of Novara, on March 23, had prostrated
Piedmont, and caused the abdication of its king, Charles
Albert. The Tuscan Republic had come and gone, and
the Grand Duke had re-entered his capital under the
protection of Austrian bayonets. Sicily had been reduced
to subjection to the Bourbons of Naples. On July 2 the
French entered Rome, bringing back the Pope cured of his
leanings to reform and constitutional government; on the
24th, Venice, after an heroic resistance, capitulated to the
Austrians. The struggle was over for the time; the longing
for liberty becomes, of necessity, silent; and we hear little,
for a space, of Italian politics. For the moment it might
seem justifiable to despair of the republic.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Bagni di Lucca, Toscana: [about July 1849].<br />

<p>At last, you will say, dearest friend. The truth is, I have
not been forgetting you (how far from that!) but wandering
in search of cool air and a cool bough among all the olive
trees to build our summer nest on. My husband has been
suffering beyond what one could shut one's eyes to in consequence
of the great mental shock of last March&mdash;loss of
appetite, loss of sleep, looks quite worn and altered. His
spirits never rallied except with an effort, and every letter
from New Cross threw him back into deep depressions. I
was very anxious, and feared much that the end of it all
(the intense heat of Florence assisting) would be a nervous
fever or something similar. And I had the greatest difficulty
in persuading him to leave Florence for a month or two&mdash;he
who generally delights so in travelling, had no mind for
change or movement. I had to say and swear that baby
and I couldn't bear the heat, and that we must and would
go away. <i>Ce que femme veut</i>, if the latter is at all reasonable,
or the former persevering. At last I gained the
victory. It was agreed that we two should go on an
exploring journey to find out where we could have most
shadow at least expense; and we left our child with his
nurse and Wilson while we were absent. We went along
the coast to Spezzia, saw Carrara with the white marble
mountains, passed through the olive forests and the vineyards,
avenues of acacia trees, chestnut woods, glorious
surprises of most exquisite scenery. I say olive forests
advisedly; the olive grows like a forest tree in those regions,
shading the ground with tents of silvery network. The
olive near Florence is but a shrub in comparison, and I
have learnt to despise a little, too, the Florentine vine,
which does not swing such portcullises of massive dewy
green from one tree to another as along the whole road
where we travelled. Beautiful, indeed, it was. Spezzia
wheels the blue sea into the arms of the wooded mountains,
and we had a glance at Shelley's house at Lerici. It was
melancholy to me, of course. I was not sorry that the
lodgings we inquired about were far above our means. We
returned on our steps (after two days in the dirtiest of
possible inns), saw Seravezza, a village in the mountains,
where rock, river, and wood enticed us to stay, and the
inhabitants drove us off by their unreasonable prices. It is
curious, but just in proportion to the want of civilisation the
prices rise in Italy. If you haven't cups and saucers you are
made to pay for plate. Well, so finding no rest for the

sole of our feet, I persuaded Robert to go to the Baths of
Lucca, only to see them. We were to proceed afterwards
to San Marcello or some safer wilderness. We had both of
us, but he chiefly, the strongest prejudice against these Baths
of Lucca, taking them for a sort of wasp's nest of scandal
and gaming, and expecting to find everything trodden flat
by the Continental English; yet I wanted to see the place,
because it is a place to see after all. So we came, and were
so charmed by the exquisite beauty of the scenery, by the
coolness of the climate and the absence of our countrymen,
political troubles serving admirably our private requirements,
that we made an offer for rooms on the spot, and returned
to Florence for baby and the rest of our establishment
without further delay. Here we are, then; we have been
here more than a fortnight. We have taken an apartment
for the season&mdash;four months&mdash;paying twelve pounds for the
whole term, and hoping to be able to stay till the end of
October. The living is cheaper than even at Florence, so
that there has been no extravagance in coming here. In
fact, Florence is scarcely tenable during the summer from
the excessive heat by day and night, even if there were no
particular motive for leaving it. We have taken a sort of eagle's
nest in this place, the highest house of the highest of the three
villages which are called the Bagni di Lucca, and which lie
at the heart of a hundred mountains sung to continually by
a rushing mountain stream. The sound of the river and of
the cicala is all the noise we hear. Austrian drums and
carriage wheels cannot vex us; God be thanked for it; the
silence is full of joy and consolation. I think my husband's
spirits are better already and his appetite improved.
Certainly little babe's great cheeks are growing rosier and
rosier. He is out all day when the sun is not too strong,
and Wilson will have it that he is prettier than the whole
population of babies here. He fixes his blue eyes on
everybody and smiles universal benevolence, rather too
indiscriminately it might be if it were not for Flush. But
certainly, on the whole he prefers Flush. He pulls his ears
and rides on him, and Flush, though his dignity does not
approve of being used as a pony, only protests by turning
his head round to kiss the little bare dimpled feet. A
merrier, sweeter-tempered child there can't be than our
baby, and people wonder at his being so forward at four
months old and think there must be a mistake in his age.
He is so strong that when I put out two fingers and he has
seized them in his fists he can draw himself up on his feet,
but we discourage this forwardness, which is not desirable,
say the learned. Children of friends of mine at ten months
and a year can't do so much. Is it not curious that <i>my</i>
child should be remarkable for strength and fatness? He
has a beaming, thinking little face, too; oh, I wish you
could see it. Then my own strength has wonderfully improved,
just as my medical friends prophesied; and it seems
like a dream when I find myself able to climb the hills with
Robert and help him to lose himself in the forests. I have
been growing stronger and stronger, and where it is to stop
I can't tell, really; I can do as much, or more, now than at
any point of my life since I arrived at woman's estate. The
air of this place seems to penetrate the heart and not the lungs
only; it draws you, raises you, excites you. Mountain air
without its keenness, sheathed in Italian sunshine, think
what <i>that</i> must be! And the beauty and the solitude&mdash;for
with a few paces we get free of the habitations of men&mdash;all
is delightful to me. What is peculiarly beautiful and
wonderful is the variety of the shapes of the mountains. They
are a multitude, and yet there is no likeness. None, except
where the golden mist comes and transfigures them into
one glory. For the rest, the mountain there wrapt in the
chestnut forest is not like that bare peak which tilts against
the sky, nor like that serpent twine of another which seems
to move and coil in the moving coiling shadow. Oh, I
wish you were here. You would enjoy the shade of the
chestnut trees, and the sound of the waterfalls, and at nights
seem to be living among the stars; the fireflies are so
thick, you would like that too. We have subscribed to a
French library where there are scarcely any new books. I have
read Bernard's 'Gentilhomme Campagnard' (see how <i>arri&eacute;r&eacute;s</i>
we are in French literature!), and thought it the dullest and
worst of his books. I wish I could see the 'Memoirs of
Louis Napoleon,' but there is no chance of such good
fortune. All this egotism has been written with a heart full
of thoughts of you and anxieties for you. Do write to me
directly and say first how your precious health is, and then
that you have ceased to suffer pain for your friends....
But your dear self chiefly&mdash;how are you, my dearest Miss
Mitford? I do long so for good news of you. On our
arrival here Mr. Lever called on us. A most cordial
vivacious manner, a glowing countenance, with the animal
spirits somewhat predominant over the intellect, yet the
intellect by no means in default; you can't help being
surprised into being pleased with him, whatever your previous
inclination may be. Natural too, and a <i>gentleman</i>
past mistake. His eldest daughter is nearly grown up, and
his youngest six months old. He has children of every sort
of intermediate age almost, but he himself is young enough
still. Not the slightest Irish accent. He seems to have
spent nearly his whole life on the Continent and by no
means to be tired of it. Ah, dearest Miss Mitford, hearts
feel differently, adjust themselves differently before the prick
of sorrow, and I confess I agree with Robert. There are
places stained with the blood of my heart for ever, and
where I could not bear to stand again. If duty called him
to New Cross it would be otherwise, but his sister is rather
inclined to come to us, I think, for a few weeks in the
autumn perhaps. Only these are scarcely times for plans
concerning foreign travel. It is something to talk of. It
has been a great disappointment to me the not going to
England this year, but I could not run the risk of the bitter
pain to him. May God bless you from all pain! Love me
and write to me, who am ever and ever your affectionate
E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Bagni di Lucca: August 11, 1849.<br />

<p>I thank you, dearest friend, for your most affectionate
and welcome letter would seem to come by instinct, and we
have thanked you in our thoughts long before this moment,
when I begin at last to write some of them. Do believe
that to value your affection and to love you back again are
parts of our life, and that it must be always delightful to us
to read in your handwriting or to hear in your voice that we
are not exiled from your life. Give us such an assurance
whenever you can. Shall we not have it face to face at
Florence, when the booksellers let you go? And meantime
there is the post; do write to us.... Did you ever see
this place, I wonder? The coolness, the charm of the
mountains, whose very heart you seem to hear beating in
the rush of the little river, the green silence of the chestnut
forests, and the seclusion which anyone may make for
himself by keeping clear of the valley-villages; all these
things drew us. We took a delightful apartment over the
heads of the whole world in the highest house of the Bagni
Caldi, where only the donkeys and the <i>portantini</i> can
penetrate, and where we sit at the open windows and hear
nothing but the cicale. Not a mosquito! think of that!
The thermometer ranges from sixty-eight to seventy-four,
but the seventy-four has been a rare excess: the nights,
mornings, and evenings are exquisitely cool. Robert and I
go out and lose ourselves in the woods and mountains, and
sit by the waterfalls on the starry and moonlit nights, and
neither by night nor day have the fear of picnics before our
eyes. We were observing the other day that we never met
anybody except a monk girt with a rope, now and then, or
a barefooted peasant. The sight of a pink parasol never
startles us into unpleasant theories of comparative anatomy.
One cause, perhaps, may be that on account of political
matters it is a delightfully 'bad season,' but, also, we are
too high for the ordinary walkers, who keep to the valley
and the flatter roads. Robert is better, looking better, and
in more healthy spirits; and we are both enjoying this
great sea of mountains and our way of life here altogether.
Of course, we remembered to go back to Florence for baby
and the rest of our little establishment, and we mean to stay
as long as we can, perhaps to the end of October. Baby
is in the triumph of health and full-blown roses, and as
he does not hide himself in the woods like his ancestors,
but smiles at everybody, he is the most popular of possible
babies.... We had him baptised before we left Florence, without
godfathers and godmothers, in the simplicities of the French
Lutheran Church. I gave him your kiss as a precious
promise that you would love him one day like a true dear
Aunt Nina; and I promise you on my part that he shall be
taught to understand both the happiness and the honour of
it. Robert is expecting a visit from his sister in the course
of this autumn. She has suffered much, and the change
will be good for her, even if, as she says, she can stay with
us only a few weeks. With her we shall have your book, to
be disinherited of which so long has been hard on us.
Robert's own we have not seen yet. It must be satisfactory
to you to have had such a clear triumph after all the dust
and toil of the way. And now tell me, won't it be <i>necessary</i>
for you to come again to Italy for what remains to be done?
Poor Florence is quiet enough under the heel of Austria,
and Leopold 'l'intrepido,' as he was happily called by a
poet of Viareggio in a welcoming burst of inspiration, sits
undisturbed at the Pitti. I despair of the republic in Italy,
or rather of Italy altogether. The instructed are not
patriotic, and the patriots are not instructed. We want not
only a <i>man</i>, but men, and we must throw, I fear, the bones
of their race behind us before the true deliverers can spring
up. Still, it is not all over; there will be deliverance
presently, but it will not be now. We are full of painful
sympathy for poor Venice. There! why write more about
politics? It makes us sick enough to think of Austrians in
our Florence without writing the thought out into greater
expansion. Only don't let the 'Times' newspaper persuade
you that there is no stepping with impunity out of England.
... We have 'lectures on Shakespeare' just now by a Mr.
Stuart, who is enlightening the English barbarians at the
lower village, and quoting Mrs. Jameson to make his
discourse more brilliant. We like to hear 'Mrs. Jameson
observes.' Give our love to dear Gerardine. I am anxious
for her happiness and yours involved in it. Love and
remember us, dearest friend.</p>

<p>Your E.B.B., or rather, BA.</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>The following note is added in Mr. Browning's handwriting:</p>
</div>

<p>Dear Aunt Nina,&mdash;Will there be three years before I see
you again? And Geddie; does she not come to Italy?
When we passed through Pisa the other day, we went to
your old inn in love of you, and got your very room to dine
in (the landlord is dead and gone, as is Peveruda&mdash;of the
other house, you remember). There were the old vile
prints, the old look-out into the garden, with its orange
trees and painted sentinel watching them. Ba must have
told you about our babe, and the little else there is to tell&mdash;that
is, for <i>her</i> to tell, for she is not likely to encroach upon
<i>my</i> story which I <i>could</i> tell of her entirely angel nature, as
divine a heart as God ever made; I know more of her every
day; I, who thought I knew something of her five years
ago! I think I know you, too, so I love you and am</p>

Ever yours and dear Geddie's<br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Bagni di Lucca: August 31, 1849.<br />

<p>I told Mr. Lever what you thought of him, dearest
friend, and then he said, all in a glow and animation, that
you were not only his own delight but the delight of his
children, which is affection by refraction, isn't it? Quite
gratified he seemed by the hold of your good opinion. Not
only is he the notability <i>par excellence</i> of these Baths of
Lucca, where he has lived a whole year, during the snows
upon the mountains, but he presides over the weekly balls
at the casino where the English 'do congregate' (all except
Robert and me), and is said to be the light of the flambeaux
and the spring of the dancers. There is a general desolation
when he <i>will</i> retire to play whist. In addition to
which he really seems to be loving and loveable in his
family. You always see him with his children and his wife;
he drives her and her baby up and down along the only
carriageable road of Lucca: so set down that piece of
domestic life on the bright side in the broad charge against
married authors; now do. I believe he is to return to
Florence this winter with his family, having had enough of
the mountains. Have you read 'Roland Cashel,' isn't <i>that</i>
the name of his last novel? The 'Athenaeum' said of it
that it was '<i>new ground</i>,' and praised it. I hear that he gets
a hundred pounds for each monthly number. Oh, how
glad I was to have your letter, written in such pain, read in
such pleasure! It was only fair to tell me in the last lines
that the face-ache was better, to keep off a fit of remorse.
I do hope that Mr. May is not right about neuralgia, because
that is more difficult to cure than pain which arises from
the teeth. Tell me how you are in all ways. I look into
your letters eagerly for news of your health, then of your
spirits, which are a part of health. The cholera makes me
very frightened for my dearest people in London, and
silence, the last longer than usual, ploughs up my days
and nights into long furrows. The disease rages in the
neighbourhood of my husband's family, and though Wimpole
Street has been hitherto clear, who can calculate on what
may be? My head goes round to think of it. And papa,
who <i>will</i> keep going into that horrible city! Even if my
sisters and brothers should go into the country as every
year, he will be left, he is no more movable than St.
Paul's. My sister-in-law will probably not come to us
as soon as she intended, through a consideration for her
father, who ought not, Robert thinks, to stay alone in the
midst of such contingencies, so perhaps we may go to seek
her ourselves in the spring, if she does not seek us out
before in Italy. God keep us all, and near to one another.
Love runs dreadful risks in the world. Yet Love is, how
much the best thing in the world? We have had a great
event in our house. Baby has cut a tooth.... His little
happy laugh is always ringing through the rooms. He is
afraid of nobody or nothing in the world, and was in fits
of ecstasy at the tossing of the horse's head, when he rode
on Wilson's knee five or six miles the other day to a village
in the mountains&mdash;screaming for joy, she said. He is not
six months yet by a fortnight! His father loves him;
passionately, and the sentiment is reciprocated, I assure
you. We have had the coolest of Italian summers at these
Baths of Lucca, the thermometer at the hottest hour of the
hottest day only at seventy-six, and generally at sixty-eight
or seventy. The nights invariably cool. Now the freshness
of the air is growing almost too fresh. I only hope we shall
be able (for the cold) to keep our intention of staying here
till the end of October, I have enjoyed it so entirely, and
shall be so sorry to break off this happy silence into the
Austrian drums at poor Florence. And then we want to see
the vintage. Some grapes are ripe already, but it is not
vintage time. We have every kind of good fruit, great
water-melons, which with both arms I can scarcely carry, at
twopence halfpenny each, and figs and peaches cheap in
proportion. And the place agrees with Baby, and has done
good to my husband's spirits, though the only 'amusement'
or distraction he has is looking at the mountains and
climbing among the woods with me. Yes, we have been
reading some French romances, 'Monte Cristo,' for instance,
I for the second time&mdash;but I have liked it, to read it with
him. That Dumas certainly has power; and to think of
the scramble there was for his brains a year or two ago in
Paris! For a man to write so much and so well together
is a miracle. Do you mean that they have left off writing&mdash;those
French writers&mdash;or that they have tired you out with
writing that looks faint beside the rush of facts, as the range
of French politics show those? Has not Eug&egrave;ne Sue been
illustrating the passions? Somebody told me so. Do <i>you</i>
tell me how you like the French President, and whether he
will ever, in your mind, sit on Napoleon's throne. It
seems to me that he has given proof, as far as the evidence
goes, of prudence, integrity, and conscientious patriotism;
the situation is difficult, and he fills it honorably. The
Rome business has been miserably managed; this is the
great blot on the character of his government. But I, for
my own part (my husband is not so minded), do consider
that the French motive has been good, the intention pure,
the occupation of Rome by the Austrians being imminent
and the French intervention the only means (with the
exception of a European war) of saving Rome from the hoof
of the Absolutists. At the same time if Pius IX. is the
obstinate idiot he seems to be, good and tenderhearted man
as he surely is, and if the old abuses are to be restored, why
Austria might as well have done her own dirty work and
saved French hands from the disgrace of it. It makes us
two very angry. Robert especially is furious. We are
not within reach of the book you speak of, 'Portraits des
Orateurs Fran&ccedil;ais' oh, we might nearly as well live on a
desert island as far as modern books go. And here, at
Lucca, even Robert can't catch sight of even the 'Athenaeum.'
We have a two-day old 'Galignani,' and think ourselves
royally off; and then this little shop with French books in
it, just a few, and the 'Gentilhomme Campagnard' the
latest published. Yes, but somebody lent us the first
volume of 'Chateaubriand's M&eacute;moires.' Have you seen
it? Curiously uninteresting, considering 'the man and the
hour.' He writes of his youth with a grey goose quill; the
paper is all wrinkled. And then he is not frank; he must
have more to tell than he tells. I looked for a more intense
and sincere book <i>outre tombe</i> certainly. I am busy
about my new edition, that is all at present, but some things
are written. Good of Mr. Chorley (he is <i>good</i>) to place
you face to face with Robert's books, and I am glad you
like 'Colombe' and 'Luria.' Dear Mr. Kenyon's poems
we have just received and are about to read, and I am
delighted at a glance to see that he has inserted the
'Gipsy Carol,' which in MS. was such a favorite of
mine. Really, is he so rich? I am glad of it, if he is.
Money could not be in more generous and intelligent
hands. Dearest Miss Mitford, you are only just in being
trustful of my affection for you. Never do I forget
nor cease to love you. Write and tell me of your dear
self; how you are <i>exactly</i>, and whether you have been
at Three Mile Cross all the summer. May God bless
you. Robert's regards. Can you read? Love a little
your</p>

<p>Ever affectionate<br />

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Bagni di Lucca: October 1, [1849].<br />

<p>There seems to be a fatality about our letters, dearest
friend, only the worst fate comes to me! I lose, and you
are <i>near</i> losing! And I should not have liked you to lose
any least proof of my thinking of you, lest a worst loss
should happen to me as a consequence, even worse than
the loss of your letters; for then, perhaps, and by degrees,
you might leave off thinking of Robert and me, which, rich
as we are in this mortal world, I do assure you we could
neither of us afford.... We have had much quiet enjoyment
here in spite of everything, read some amusing books
(Dumas and Sue&mdash;shake your head!), and seen our child
grow fuller of roses and understanding day by day. Before
he was six months old he would stretch out his hands and
his feet too, when bidden to do so, and his little mouth to
kiss you. This is said to be a miracle of forwardness
among the learned. He knows Robert and me quite well
as 'Papa' and 'Mama,' and laughs for joy when he meets
us out of doors. Robert is very fond of him, and threw
me into a fit of hilarity the other day by springing away
from his newspaper in an indignation against me because
he hit his head against the floor rolling over and over. 'Oh,
Ba, I really can't trust you!' Down Robert was on the
carpet in a moment, to protect the precious head. He
takes it to be made of Venetian glass, I am certain.
We may leave this place much sooner than the end of
October, as everything depends upon the coming in of the
cold. It will be the end of October, won't it, before
Gerardine can reach Florence? I wish I knew. We have
made an excursion into the mountains, five miles deep,
with all our household, baby and all, on horseback and
donkeyback, and people open their eyes at our having
performed such an exploit&mdash;I and the child. Because it is
five miles straight up the Duomo; you wonder how any
horse could keep its footing, the way is so precipitous, up
the exhausted torrent courses, and with a palm's breadth
between you and the headlong ravines. Such scenery.
Such a congregation of mountains: looking alive in the
stormy light we saw them by. We dined with the goats,
and baby lay on my shawl rolling and laughing. He wasn't
in the least tired, not he! I won't say so much for myself.
The Mr. Stuart who lectured here on Shakespeare (I think
I told you that) couldn't get through a lecture without quoting
you, and wound up by a declaration that no English critic
had done so much for the divine poet as a woman&mdash;Mrs.
Jameson. He appears to be a cultivated and refined person,
and especially versed in German criticism, and we mean to
<i>use</i> his society a little when we return to Florence, where
he resides.... What am I to say about Robert's idleness
and mine? I scold him about it in a most anti-conjugal
manner, but, you know, his spirits and nerves have been
shaken of late; we must have patience. As for me, I am
much better, and do something, really, now and then. Wait,
and you shall have us both on you; too soon, perhaps.
May God bless you. How are your friends? Lady Byron,
Madame de Goethe. The dreadful cholera has made us
anxious about England.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>Mr. Browning adds the following note:</p>
</div>

<p>Dear Aunt Nina,&mdash;Ba will have told you everything,
and how we wish you and Geddie all manner of happiness.
I hope we shall be in Florence when she passes through it.
The place is otherwise distasteful to me, with the creeping
curs and the floggers of the same. But the weather is
breaking up here, and I suppose we ought to go back soon.
Shall you indeed come to Italy next year? That will
indeed be pleasant to expect. We hope to go to England
in the spring. What comes of 'hoping,' however, we [know]
by this time.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Bagni di Lucca: October 2, 1849.<br />

<p>Thank you, my dearest Miss Mitford: It is great
comfort to know that you are better, and that the cholera
does not approach your neighbourhood. My brothers and
sisters have gone to Worthing for a few weeks; and though
my father (dearest Papa!) is not persuadeable, I fear, into
joining them, yet it is something to know that the horrible
pestilence is abating in London. Oh, it has made me so
anxious: I have caught with such a frightened haste at the
newspaper to read the 'returns,' leaving even such subjects
as Rome and the President's letter to quite the last, as if
they were indifferent, or, at most, bits of Mrs. Manning's
murder. By the way and talking of murder, how do you
account for the crown of wickedness which England bears
just now over the heads of the nations, in murders of all
kinds, by poison, by pistol, by knife? In this poor
Tuscany, which has not brains enough to govern itself, as
you observe, and as really I can't deny, there have been
two murders (properly so called) since we came, just three
years ago, one from jealousy and one from revenge
(respectable motives compared to the advantages of the
burying societies!), and the horror on all sides was great, as
if the crime were some rare prodigy, which, indeed, it is in
this country. We have <i>no punishment of death</i> here,
observe! The people are gentle, courteous, refined, and
tenderhearted. What Balzac would call 'femmelette.' All
Tuscany is 'Lucien' himself. The leaning to the artistic
nature without the strength of genius implies demoralisation
in most cases, and it is this which makes your 'good
for nothing poets and poetesses,' about which I love so to
battle with you. Genius, I maintain always, you know, is
a purifying power and goes with high moral capacities.
Well, and so you invite us home to civilisation and 'the
&quot;Times&quot; newspaper.' We <i>mean</i> to go next spring, and shall
certainly do so unless something happen to catch us and
keep us in a net. But always something does happen: and
I have so often built upon seeing England, and been
precipitated from the fourth storey, that I have learnt to
think warily now. I hunger and thirst for the sight of some
faces; must I not long, do you think, to see your face?
And then, I shall be properly proud to show my child to
those who loved me before him. He is beginning to
understand everything&mdash;chiefly in Italian, of course, as his
nurse talks in her sleep, I fancy, and can't be silent a
second in the day&mdash;and when told to 'dare un bacio a
questo povero Flush,' he mixes his little face with Flush's
ears in a moment.... You would wonder to see Flush
just now. He suffered this summer from the climate
somewhat as usual, though not nearly as much as usual;
and having been insulted oftener than once by a supposition
of 'mange,' Robert wouldn't bear it any longer (he is as
fond of Flush as I am), and, taking a pair of scissors, clipped
him all over into the likeness of a lion, much to his
advantage in both health and appearance. In the winter
he is always quite well; but the heat and the fleas together
are too much in the summer. The affection between baby
and him is not equal, baby's love being far the stronger.
He, on the other hand, looks down upon baby. What bad
news you tell me of our French writers! What! Is it
possible that Dumas even is struck dumb by the revolution?
His first works are so incomparably the worst that I can't
admit your theory of the 'first runnings.' So of Balzac.
So of Sue! George Sand is probably writing 'banners'
for the 'Reds,' which, considering the state of parties
in France, does not really give me a higher opinion of
her intelligence or virtue. Ledru Rollin's<a name="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> <i>confidante</i> and
councillor can't occupy an honorable position, and I am
sorry, for her sake and ours. When we go to Florence we
must try to get the 'Portraits' and Lamartine's autobiography,
which I still more long to see. So, two women
were in love with him, were they? That must be a comfort
to look back upon, now, when nobody will have him. I
see by extracts from his newspaper in Galignani that he
can't be accused of temporising with the Socialists any
longer, whatever other charge may be brought against him:
and if, as he says, it was he who made the French republic,
he is by no means irreproachable, having made a bad and
false thing. The President's letter about Rome<a name="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> has
delighted us. A letter worth writing and reading! We
read it first in the Italian papers (long before it was printed
in Paris), and the amusing thing was that where he speaks
of the 'hostile influences' (of the cardinals) they had misprinted
it '<i>orribili</i> influenze,' which must have turned still
colder the blood in the veins of Absolutist readers. The
misprint was not corrected until long after&mdash;more than a
week, I think. The Pope is just a pope; and, since you
give George Sand credit for having known it, I am the more
vexed that Blackwood (under 'orribili influenze') did not
publish the poem I wrote two years ago,<a name="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> in the full glare
and burning of the Pope-enthusiasm, which Robert and I
never caught for a moment. Then, <i>I</i> might have passed a
little for a prophetess as well as George Sand! Only, to
confess a truth, the same poem would have proved how fairly
I was taken in by our Tuscan Grand Duke. Oh, the traitor!</p>

<p>I saw the 'Ambarvalia'<a name="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> reviewed somewhere&mdash;I fancy
in the 'Spectator '&mdash;and was not much struck by the
extracts. They may, however, have been selected without
much discrimination, and probably were. I am very glad
that you like the gipsy carol in dear Mr. Kenyon's volume,
because it is, and was in MS., a great favorite of mine.
There are excellent things otherwise, as must be when he
says them: one of the most radiant of benevolences with
one of the most refined of intellects! How the paper
seems to dwindle as I would fain talk on more. I have
performed a great exploit, ridden on a donkey five miles
deep into the mountains to an almost inaccessible volcanic
ground not far from the stars. Robert on horseback, and
Wilson and the nurse (with baby) on other donkeys;
guides, of course. We set off at eight in the morning and
returned at six P.M., after dining on the mountain pinnacle,
I dreadfully tired, but the child laughing as usual, and
burnt Brick-colour for all bad effect. No horse or ass,
untrained to the mountains, could have kept foot a moment
where we penetrated, and even as it was one could not
help the natural thrill. No road except the bed of exhausted
torrents above and through the chestnut forests, and
precipitous beyond what you would think possible for
ascent or descent. Ravines tearing the ground to pieces
under your feet. The scenery, sublime and wonderful,
satisfied us wholly, however, as we looked round on the
world of innumerable mountains bound faintly with the
grey sea, and not a human habitation. I hope you will go
to London this winter; it will be good for you, it seems to
me. Take care of yourself, my much and ever loved friend!
I love you and think of you indeed. Write of your health,
remembering this,</p>

<p>And your affectionate,<br />
E.B.B.</p>

direct to <i>Florence</i>, as we shall be there in the course of
October.</p>

<p>To Florence, accordingly, they returned in October, and
settled down once more in Casa Guidi for the winter.
Mrs. Browning's principal literary occupation at this time
was the preparation of a new edition of her poems, including
nearly all the contents of the 'Seraphim' volume of 1838,
more or less revised, as well as the 'Poems' of 1844. This
edition, published in 1850, has formed the basis of all subsequent
editions of her poems. Meanwhile her husband was
engaged in the preparation of 'Christmas Eve and Easter
Day,' which was also published in the course of 1850.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: December I, 1849.<br />

<p>My ever loved friend, you will have wondered at this
unusual silence; and so will my sisters to whom I wrote
just now, after a pause as little in my custom. It was not
the fault of my head and heart, but of this unruly body,
which has been laid up again in the way of all flesh of
mine....</p>

<p>I am well again now, only obliged to keep quiet and
give up my grand walking excursions, which poor Robert
used to be so boastful of. If he is vain about anything in
the world, it is about my improved health, and I used to
say to him, 'But you needn't talk so much to people of
how your wife walked here with you and there with you, as
if a wife with a pair of feet was a miracle of nature.' Now
the poor feet have fallen into their old ways again. Ah,
but if God pleases it won't be for long....</p>

<p>The American authoress, Miss Fuller, with whom we
had had some slight intercourse by letter, and who has been
at Rome during the siege, as a devoted friend of the republicans
and a meritorious attendant on the hospitals, has
taken us by surprise at Florence, retiring from the Roman
field with a husband and child above a year old. Nobody
had even suspected a word of this underplot, and her
American friends stood in mute astonishment before this
apparition of them here. The husband is a Roman marquis,
appearing amiable and gentlemanly, and having fought well,
they say, at the siege, but with no pretension to cope with
his wife on any ground appertaining to the intellect. She
talks, and he listens. I always wonder at that species of
marriage; but people are so different in their matrimonial
ideals that it may answer sometimes. This Mdme.
Ossoli saw George Sand in Paris&mdash;was at one of her
soir&eacute;es&mdash;and called her 'a magnificent creature.' The
soir&eacute;e was 'full of rubbish' in the way of its social composition,
which George Sand likes, <i>nota bene</i>. If Mdme.
Ossoli called it '<i>rubbish</i>' it must have been really
rubbish&mdash;not expressing anything conventionally so&mdash;she being
one of the out and out <i>Reds</i> and scorners of grades of
society. She said that she did not see Balzac. Balzac
went into the world scarcely at all, frequenting the lowest
caf&eacute;s, so that it was difficult to track him out. Which
information I receive doubtingly. The rumours about
Balzac with certain parties in Paris are not likely to be
too favorable nor at all reliable, I should fancy; besides,
I never entertain disparaging thoughts of my demi-gods
unless they should be forced upon me by evidence you
must know. I have not made a demi-god of Louis
Napoleon, by the way&mdash;no, and I don't mean it. I expect
some better final result than he has just proved himself to
be of the French Revolution, with all its bitter and cruel
consequences hitherto, so I can't quite agree with you.
Only so far, that he has shown himself up to this point to be
an upright man with noble impulses, and that I give him
much of my sympathy and respect in the difficult position
held by him. A man of genius he does not seem to be&mdash;and
what, after all, will he manage to do at Rome? I
don't take up the frantic Republican cry in Italy. I know
too well the want of knowledge and the consequent want of i
effective faith and energy among the Italians; but there
is a stain upon France in the present state of the Roman
affair, and I don't shut my eyes to that either. To cast
Rome helpless and bound into the hands of the priests is
dishonor to the actors, however we consider the act; and
for the sake of France, even more than for the sake of Italy,
I yearn to see the act cancelled. Oh, we have had the
sight of Clough and Burbidge, at last. Clough has more
thought, Burbidge more music; but I am disappointed in
the book on the whole. What I like infinitely better is
Clough's 'Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich,' a 'long vacation
pastoral,' written in loose and more-than-need-be unmusical
hexameters, but full of vigour and freshness, and with
passages and indeed whole scenes of great beauty and
eloquence. It seems to have been written before the other
poems. Try to get it, if you have not read it already. I
feel certain you will like it and think all the higher of the
poet. Oh, it strikes both Robert and me as being worth
twenty of the other little book, with its fragmentary,
dislocated, unartistic character. Arnold's volume has two
good poems in it: 'The Sick King of Bokhara' and 'The
Deserted Merman.' I like them both. But none of these
writers are <i>artists</i>, whatever they may be in future days.
Have you read 'Shirley,' and is it as good as 'Jane Eyre'?
We heard not long since that Mr. Chorley had discovered
the author, <i>the</i> 'Currer Bell.' A woman, most certainly.
We hear, too, that three large editions of the 'Princess' are
sold. So much the happier for England and poetry.</p>

<p>Dearest dear Miss Mitford, mind you write to me, and
don't pay me out in my own silence! <i>You</i> have not been
ill, I hope and trust. Write and tell me every little thing
of yourself&mdash;how you are, and whether there is still danger
of your being uprooted from Three Mile Cross. I love
and think of you always. Fancy Flush being taken in the
light of a rival by baby! Oh, baby was quite jealous the
other day, and strugggled and kicked to get to me because
he saw Flush leaning his pretty head on my lap. There's
a great strife for privileges between those two. May God
bless you! My husband's kind regards always, while I
am your most</p>

<p>Affectionate<br />
E.B.B.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: January 9, 1850.<br />

<p>Thank you, ever dearest Miss Mitford, for this welcome
letter written on your birthday! May the fear of small-pox
have passed away long before now, and every hope and
satisfaction have strengthened and remained!...</p>

<p>May God bless you and give you many happy years,
you who can do so much towards the happiness of others.
May I not answer for my own?...</p>

<p>Little Wiedeman began to crawl on Christmas Day.
Before, he used to roll. We throw things across the floor
and he crawls for them like a little dog, on all fours....</p>

<p>He has just caught a cold, which I make more fuss
about than I ought, say the wise; but I can't get resigned
to the association of any sort of suffering with his laughing
dimpled little body&mdash;it is the blowing about in the wind
of such a heap of roses. So you prefer 'Shirley' to 'Jane
Eyre'! Yet I hear from nobody such an opinion; yet you
are very probably right, for 'Shirley' may suffer from the
natural reaction of the public mind. What you tell me of
Tennyson interests me as everything about him must. I
like to think of him digging gardens&mdash;room for cabbage and
all. At the same time, what he says about the public
'<i>hating</i> poetry' is certainly not a word for Tennyson.
Perhaps no true poet, having claims upon attention <i>solely</i>
through his poetry, has attained so certain a success with
such short delay. Instead of being pelted (as nearly every
true poet has been), he stands already on a pedestal, and is
recognised as a master spirit not by a coterie but by the
great public. Three large editions of the 'Princess' have
already been sold. If he isn't satisfied after all, I think
he is wrong. Divine poet as he is, and no laurel being
too leafy for him, yet he must be an unreasonable
man, and not understanding of the growth of the laurel
trees and the nature of a reading public. With regard to
the other garden-digger, dear Mr. Home, I wish as you do
that I could hear something satisfactory of him. I wrote
from Lucca in the summer, and have no answer. The
latest word concerning him is the announcement in the
'Athenaeum' of a third edition of his 'Gregory the Seventh,'
which we were glad to see, but very, very glad we should
be to have news of his prosperity in the flesh as well as in
the <i>litterae scriptae</i>....</p>

<p>I have not been out of doors these two months, but
people call me 'looking well,' and a newly married niece of
Miss Bayley's, the accomplished Miss Thomson, who has
become the wife of Dr. Emil Braun (the learned German
secretary of the Archaeological Society), and just passed
through Florence on her way to Rome, where they are to
reside, declared that the change she saw in me was
miraculous&mdash;'wonderful indeed.' I took her to look at Wiedeman
in his cradle, fast asleep, and she won my heart (over again,
for always she was a favorite of mine) by exclaiming at
his prettiness. Charmed, too, we both were with Dr.
Braun&mdash;I mean Robert and I were charmed. He has a mixture
of fervour and simplicity which is still more delightfully
picturesque in his foreign English. Oh, he speaks English
perfectly, only with an obvious accent enough. I am sure
we should be cordial friends, if the lines had fallen to us in
the same pleasant places; but he is fixed at Rome, and we
are half afraid of the enervating effects of the Roman
climate on the constitutions of children. Tell me, do you
hear often from Mr. Chorley? It quite pains us to observe
from his manner of writing the great depression of his
spirits. His mother was ill in the summer, but plainly the
sadness does not arise entirely or chiefly from this cause.
He seems to me over-worked, taxed in the spirit. I advise
nobody to give up work; but that 'Athenaeum' labour is a
sort of treadmill discipline in which there is no progress,
nor triumph, and I do wish he would give that up and
come out to us with a new set of anvils and hammers.
Only, of course, he couldn't do it, even if he would, while
there is illness in his family. May there be a whole sun
of success shining on the new play! Robert is engaged on
a poem,<a name="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> and I am busy with my edition. So much to
correct, I find, and many poems to add. Plainly 'Jane
Eyre' was by a woman. It used to astound me when
sensible people said otherwise. Write to me, will you? I
long to hear again. Tell me everything of yourself; accept
my husband's true regards, and think of me as your</p>

<p>Ever affectionate<br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
Florence: January 29, 1850.<br />

<p>My dearest Sarianna,&mdash;I have waited to thank you for
your great and ready kindness about the new edition, until
now when it is fairly on its way to England. Thank you,
thank you! I am only afraid, not that you will find anything
too 'learned,' as you suggest, but a good many things too
careless, I was going to say, only Robert, with various deep
sighs for 'his poor Sarianna,' devoted himself during several
days to rearranging my arrangements, and simplifying my
complications. It was the old story of Order and Disorder
over again. He pulled out the knotted silks with an indefatigable
patience, so that really you will owe to <i>him</i> every
moment of ease and facility which may be enjoyable in the
course of the work. I am afraid that at the easiest you
will find it a vexatious business, but I throw everything on
your kindness, and am not distrustful on such a point of
weights and measures.</p>

<p>Your letter was full of sad news. Robert was deeply
affected at the account of the illness of his cousin&mdash;was in
tears before he could end the letter. I do hope that in a
day or two we may hear from you that the happy change
was confirmed as time passed on. I do hope so; it will be
joy, not merely to Robert, but to me, for indeed I never
forget the office which his kindness performed for both of
us at a crisis ripe with all the happiness of my life.</p>

<p>Then it was sad to hear of your dear father suffering
from lumbago. May the last of it have passed away long
before you get what I am writing! Tell him with my love
that Wiedeman shall hear some day (if we all live) the verses
he wrote to him; and I have it in my head that little
Wiedeman will be very sensitive to verses and kindness
too&mdash;he likes to hear anything rhythmical and musical, and he
likes to be petted and kissed&mdash;the most affectionate little
creature he is&mdash;sitting on my knee, while I give him books
to turn the leaves over (a favorite amusement), every two
minutes he puts up his little rosebud of a mouth to have a
kiss. His cold is quite gone, and he has taken advantage
of the opportunity to grow still fatter; as to his activities,
there's no end to them. His nurse and I agree that he
doesn't remain quiet a moment in the day....<a name="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p>Now the love of nephews can't bear any more, Sarianna,
can it? Only your father will take my part and say that it
isn't tedious&mdash;beyond pardoning.</p>

<p>May God bless both of you, and enable you to send a
brighter letter next time. Robert will be very anxious.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: February 18, 1850.<br />

<p>Ever dearest Miss Mitford, you <i>always</i> give me pleasure,
so for love's sake don't say that you 'seldom give it,' and
such a magical act as conjuring up for me the sight of a
new poem by Alfred Tennyson<a name="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> is unnecessary to prove
you a right beneficent enchantress. Thank you, thank you.
We are not so unworthy of your redundant kindness as to
abuse it by a word spoken or sign signified. You may
trust us indeed. But now you know how free and sincere
I am always! Now tell me. Apart from the fact of this lyric's
being a fragment of fringe from the great poet's 'singing
clothes' (as Leigh Hunt says somewhere), and apart from a
certain sweetness and rise and fall in the rhythm, do you
really see much for admiration in the poem? Is it <i>new</i> in,
any way? I admire Tennyson with the most worshipping
part of the multitude, as you are aware, but I do <i>not</i>
perceive much in this lyric, which strikes me, and Robert
also (who goes with me throughout), as quite inferior to the
other lyrical snatches in the 'Princess.' By the way, if he
introduces it in the 'Princess,' it will be the only <i>rhymed</i>
verse in the work. Robert thinks that he was thinking of
the Rhine echoes in writing it, and not of any heard in his
Irish travels. I hear that Tennyson has taken rooms above
Mr. Forster's in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and is going to try a
London life. So says Mr. Kenyon.... I am writing with
an easier mind than when I wrote last, for I was for a little
time rendered very unhappy (so unhappy that I couldn't
touch on the subject, which is always the way with me when
pain passes a certain point), by hearing accidentally that
papa was unwell and looking altered. My sister persisted
in replying to my anxieties that they were unfounded, that
I was quite absurd, indeed, in being anxious at all; only
people are not generally reformed from their absurdities
through being scolded for them. Now, however, it
really appears that the evil has passed. He left his doctor
who had given him lowering medicines, and, coincidently
with the leaving, he has recovered looks and health altogether.
Arabel says that I should think he was looking
as well as ever, if I saw him, and that appetite and spirits
are even redundant. Thank God.... To have this good
news has made me very happy, and I overflow to you accordingly.
Oh, there is pain enough from that quarter, without
hearing of his being out of health. I write to him continually
and he does not now return my letters, which is a
melancholy something gained. Now enough of such a
subject.</p>

<p>I certainly don't think that the qualities, half savage and
half freethinking, expressed in 'Jane Eyre' are likely to suit
a model governess or schoolmistress; and it amuses me to
consider them in that particular relation. Your account
falls like dew upon the parched curiosity of some of our
friends here, to whom (as mere gossip, which did not leave
you responsible) I couldn't resist the temptation of
communicating it. People <i>are</i> so curious&mdash;even here among
the Raffaels&mdash;about this particular authorship, yet nobody
seems to have read 'Shirley'; we are too slow in getting
new books. First Galignani has to pirate them himself, and
then to hand us over the spoils. By the way, there's to be
an international copyright, isn't there? Something is talked
of it in the 'Athenaeum.' Meanwhile the Americans have
already reprinted my husband's new edition. 'Landthieves,
I mean pirates.' I used to take that for a slip of the pen in
Shakespeare; but it was a slip of the pen into prophecy.
Sorry I am at Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; falling short of your warm-hearted
ideas about her! Can you understand a woman's
hating a girl because it is not a boy&mdash;her first child too?
I understand it so little that scarcely I can believe it. Some
women <i>have</i>, however, undeniably an indifference to children,
just as many men have, though it must be unnatural
and morbid in both sexes. Men often affect it&mdash;very foolishly,
if they count upon the scenic effects; affectation never
succeeds well, and this sort of affectation is peculiarly
unbecoming, except in old bachelors, for there is a pathetic
side to the question so viewed. For my part and my
husband's, we may be frank and say that we have caught
up our parental pleasures with a sort of passion. But then,
Wiedeman is such a darling little creature; who <i>could</i> help
loving the child?... Little darling! So much mischief
was not often put before into so small a body. Fancy the
child's upsetting the water jugs till he is drenched (which
charms him), pulling the brooms to pieces, and having
serious designs upon cutting up his frocks with a pair of
scissors. He laughs like an imp when he can succeed in
doing anything wrong. Now, see what you get, in return
for your kindness of 'liking to hear about' him! Almost I
have the grace to be ashamed a little. Just before I had
your letter we sent my new edition to England. I gave
much time to the revision, and did not omit reforming
some of the rhymes, although you must consider that the
irregularity of these in a certain degree rather falls in with
my system than falls out through my carelessness. So
much the worse, you will say, when a person is <i>systematically</i>
bad. The work will include the best poems of the 'Seraphim'
volume, strengthened and improved as far as the circumstances
admitted of. I had not the heart to leave out the
wretched sonnet to yourself, for your dear sake; but I rewrote
the latter half of it (for really it wasn't a sonnet at all,
and 'Una and her lion' are rococo), and so placed it with
my other poems of the same class. There are some new,
verses also.<a name="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> The Miss Hardings I have seen, and talked
with them of <i>you</i>, a sure way of finding them delightful.
But, my dearest friend, I shall not see any of the Trollope
party&mdash;it is not likely. You can scarcely image to yourself
the retired life we live, or how we have retreated from the
kind advances of the English society here. Now people
seem to understand that we are to be left alone; that
nothing is to be made of us. The fact is, we are not like
our child, who kisses everybody who smiles at him! Neither
my health nor our pecuniary circumstances, nor our inclinations
perhaps, would admit of our entering into English
society here, which is kept up much after the old English
models, with a proper disdain for Continental simplicities
of expense. We have just heard from Father Prout, who
often, he says, sees Mr. Horne, 'who is as dreamy as ever.'
So glad I am, for I was beginning to be uneasy about him.
He has not answered my letter from Lucca. The verses
in the 'Athenaeum'<a name="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> are on Sophia Cottrell's child.</p>

<p>May God bless you, dearest friend. Speak of <i>yourself</i>
more particularly to your ever affectionate</p>

<p>E.B.B.</p>

<p>Robert's kindest regards. Tell us of Mr. Chorley's
play, do.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: February 22, 1850.<br />

<p>My dearest Mrs. Martin,&mdash;Have you wondered that I
did not write before? It was not that I did not thank
you in my heart for your kind, considerate letter, but I was
unconquerably uncomfortable about papa; and, what with
the weather, which always has me in its power somehow, and
other things, I fell into a dislike of writing, which I hope
you didn't mistake for ingratitude, because it was not in the
least like the same fault. Now the severe weather (such
weather for Italy!) has broken up, and I am relieved in all
ways, having received the most happy satisfactory news
from Wimpole Street, and the assurance from my sisters
that if I were to see papa I should think him looking as well
as ever. He grew impatient with Dr. Elliotson's medicines
which, it appears, were of a very lowering character&mdash;suddenly
gave them up, and as suddenly recovered his looks and all the rest,
and everybody at home considers him to be <i>quite well</i>. It
has relieved me of a mountain's weight, and I thank God with great
joy. Oh, you must have understood how natural it was for me to be
unhappy under the other circumstances. But if you thought, dearest
friend, that <i>they</i> were necessary to induce me to write to
him the humblest and most beseeching of letters, you do
not know how I feel his alienation or my own love for him.
I With regard to my brothers, it is quite different, though
even towards <i>them</i> I may faithfully say that my affection
has borne itself higher than my pride. But as to papa, I
have never contended about the right or the wrong, I have
never irritated him by seeming to suppose that his severity
to me has been more than justice. I have confined myself
simply to a supplication for&mdash;his forgiveness of what he
called, in his own words, the only fault of my life towards
him, and an expression of the love which even I must feel
I for him, whether he forgives me or not. This has been
done in letter after letter, and they are not sent back&mdash;it is
all. In my last letter, I ventured to ask him to let it be an
understood thing that he should before the world, and to
every practical purpose, act out his idea of justice by
excluding me formally, me and mine, from every advantage
he intended his other children&mdash;that, having so been
just, he might afford to be merciful by giving me his
forgiveness and affection&mdash;all I asked and desired. My
husband and I had talked this over again and again; only
it was a difficult thing to say, you see. At last I took
courage and said it, because, doing it, papa might seem
to himself to reconcile his notion of strict justice, and
whatever remains of pity and tenderness might still be in
his heart towards me, if there are any such. I <i>know</i> he
has strong feelings at bottom&mdash;otherwise, should I love him
so?&mdash;but he has adopted a bad system, and he (as well as
I) is crushed by it.... If I were to write to you the
political rumours we hear every day, you would scarcely
think our situation improved in safety by the horrible
Austrian army. Florence bristles with cannon on all sides,
and at the first movement we are promised to be bombarded.
On the other hand, if the red republicans get uppermost
there will be a universal massacre; not a priest, according
to their own profession, will be left alive in Italy. The
constitutional party hope they are gaining strength, but the
progress which depends on intellectual growth must necessarily
be slow. That the Papacy has for ever lost its
prestige and power over souls is the only evident truth;
bright and strong enough to cling to. I hear even devout
women say: 'This cursed Pope! it's all his fault.' Protestant
places of worship are thronged with Italian faces, and the
minister of the Scotch church at Leghorn has been
threatened with exclusion from the country if he admits
Tuscans to the church communion. Politically speaking,
much will depend upon France, and I have strong hope for
France, though it is so strictly the fashion to despair of her.
Tell me dear Mr. Martin's impression and your own&mdash;everything
is good that comes from you. But most <i>particularly</i>,
tell me how you both are&mdash;tell me whether you are strong
again, dearest Mrs. Martin, for indeed I do not like to
hear of your being in the least like an invalid. Do speak
of yourself a little more. Do you know, you are very
unsatisfactory as a letter-writer when you write about
yourself&mdash;the reason being that you never do write about
yourself except by the suddenest snatches, when you can't
possibly help the reference....</p>

<p>Robert sends his true regards with those of your<br />
Gratefully affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
April 2, [1850].<br />

<p>You have perhaps thought us ungrateful people, my ever
dear friend, for this long delay in thanking you for your
beautiful and welcome present.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> Here is the truth.
Though we had the books from Rome last month, they
were snatched from us by impatient hands before we had
finished the first volume. The books are hungered and
thirsted for in Florence, and, although the English reading
club has them, they can't go fast enough from one to
another. Four of our friends entreated us for the reversion,
and although it really is only just that we should be let
read our own books first, yet Robert's generosity can't resist
the need of this person who is 'going away,' and of that
person who is 'so particularly anxious'&mdash;for particular
reasons perhaps&mdash;so we renounce the privilege you gave us
(with the pomps of this world) and are still waiting to
finish even the first volume. Our cultivated friends the
Ogilvys, who had the work from us earliest, because they
were going to Naples, were charmed with it. Mr. Kirkup
the artist, who disputes with Mr. Bezzi the glory of finding
Dante's portrait&mdash;yes, and breathes fire in the dispute&mdash;has
it now. Madame Ossoli, Margaret Fuller, the American
authoress, who brought from the siege of Rome a noble
marquis as her husband, asks for it. And your adorer
Mr. Stuart, who has lectured upon Shakespeare all the
winter, entreats for it. So when we shall be free to enjoy
it thoroughly for ourselves remains doubtful. Robert
promises every day, 'You shall have it next, certainly,' and
I only hope you will put him and me in your next edition
of the martyrs, for such a splendid exercise of the gifts
of self-renunciation. But don't fancy that we have not
been delighted with the sight of the books, with your
kindness, and besides with the impressions gathered from
a rapid examination of the qualities of the work. It
seems to us in every way a valuable and most interesting
work; it must render itself a <i>necessity</i> for art students,
and general readers and seers of pictures like me, who
carry rather sentiment than science into the consideration
of such subjects. We much admire your introduction&mdash;excellent
in all ways, besides the grace and eloquence.
Altogether, the work must set you higher with a high class
of the public, and I congratulate you on what is the gain of
all of us. Robert has begun a little pencil list of trifling
criticisms he means to finish. We both cry aloud at what
you say of Guercino's angels, and never would have said if
you had been to Fano and seen his divine picture of the
'Guardian Angel,' which affects me every time I think of it.
Our little Wiedeman had his part of pleasure in the book
by being let look at the engravings. He screamed for joy
at the miracle of so many bird-men, and kissed some of
them very reverentially, which is his usual way of expressing
admiration....</p>

<p>Whether you will like Robert's new book I don't know,
but I am sure you will admit the originality and power in it.
I wish we had the option of giving it to you, but Chapman
&amp; Hall never seem to think of our giving copies away,
nor leave them at our disposal. There is nothing <i>Italian</i>
in the book; poets are apt to be most present with the
distant. A remark of Wilson's<a name="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> used to strike me as
eminently true&mdash;that the perfectest descriptive poem (descriptive
of rural scenery) would <i>be</i> naturally produced in a
London cellar. I have read 'Shirley' lately; it is not equal
to 'Jane Eyre' in spontaneousness and earnestness. I
found it heavy, I confess, though in the mechanical part of
the writing&mdash;the compositional <i>savoir faire</i>&mdash;there is an
advance. Robert has exhumed some French books, just
now, from a little circulating library which he had not tried,
and we have been making ourselves uncomfortable over
Balzac's 'Cousin Pons.' But what a wonderful writer he
is! Who else could have taken such a subject, out of the
lowest mud of humanity, and glorified and consecrated it?
He is wonderful&mdash;there is not another word for him&mdash;profound,
as Nature is. S I complain of Florence for the want of
books. We have to dig and dig before we can get anything
new, and <i>I</i> can read the newspapers only through
Robert's eyes, who only can read them at Vieusseux's in a
room sacred from the foot of woman. And this isn't always
satisfactory to me, as whenever he falls into a state of
disgust with any political <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, he throws the whole
subject over and won't read a word more about it.
Every now and then, for instance, he ignores France
altogether, and I, who am more tolerant and more curious,
find myself suspended over an hiatus <i>(valde deflendus</i>), and
what's to be said and done? M. Thiers' speech&mdash;'Thiers
is a rascal; I make a point of not reading one word said
by M. Thiers.' M. Prudhon&mdash;'Prudhon is a madman;
who cares for Prudhon?' The President&mdash;'The President's
an ass; <i>he</i> is not worth thinking of.' And so we treat of
politics.</p>

<p>I wish you would write to us a little oftener (or rather, a
good deal) and tell us much of yourself. It made me very
sorry that you should be suffering in the grief of your
sister&mdash;you whose sympathies are so tender and quick! May it
be better with you now! Mention Lady Byron. I shall
be glad to hear that she is stronger notwithstanding this
cruel winter. We have lovely weather here now, and I am
quite well and able to walk out, and little Wiedeman rolls
with Flush on the grass of the Cascine. Dear kind Wilson
is doatingly fond of the child, and sometimes gives it as
her serious opinion that 'there never <i>was</i> such a child
before.' Of course I don't argue the point much. Now,
will you write to us? Speak of your plans particularly when
you do. We have taken this apartment on for another
year from May. May God bless you! Robert unites in
affectionate thanks and thoughts of all kinds, with your</p>

<p>At the end of March 1850, the long-deferred marriage of
Mrs. Browning's sister, Henrietta, to Captain Surtees Cook
took place. It is of interest here mainly as illustrating
Mr. Barrett's behaviour to his daughters. An application
for his consent only elicited the pronouncement, 'If
Henrietta marries you, she turns her back on this house
for ever,' and a letter to Henrietta herself reproaching
her with the 'insult' she had offered him in asking his
consent when she had evidently made up her mind to the
conclusion, and declaring that, if she married, her name
should never again be mentioned in his presence. The
marriage having thereupon taken place, his decision was
forthwith put into practice, and a second child was thenceforward
an exile from her father's house.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: [end of] April 1850.<br />

<p>You will have seen in the papers, dearest friend, the
marriage of my sister Henrietta, and will have understood
why I was longer silent than usual. Indeed, the event
has much moved me, and so much of the emotion was
painful&mdash;painfulness being inseparable from events of the sort
in our family&mdash;that I had to make an effort to realise to myself
the reasonable degree of gladness and satisfaction in her release
from a long, anxious, transitional state, and her prospect of
happiness with a man who has loved her constantly and who
is of an upright, honest, reliable, and religious mind. Our
father's objections were to his Tractarian opinions and insufficient
income. I have no sympathy myself with Tractarian
opinions, but I cannot under the circumstances think an
objection of the kind tenable by a third person, and in truth
we all know that if it had not been this objection, it would
have been another&mdash;there was no escape any way. An
engagement of five years and an attachment still longer
were to have some results; and I can't regret, or indeed do
otherwise than approve from my heart, what she has done
from hers. Most of her friends and relatives have considered
that there was no choice, and that her step is abundantly
justified. At the same time, I thank God that a letter sent
to me to ask my advice never reached me (the <i>second</i> letter
of my sisters' lost, since I left them), because no advice
<i>ought</i> to be given on any subject of the kind, and because I,
especially, should have shrunk from accepting such a responsibility.
So I only heard of the marriage three days before
it took place&mdash;no, four days before&mdash;and was upset, as you
may suppose, by the sudden news. Captain Surtees Cook's
sister was one of the bridesmaids, and his brother performed
the ceremony. The <i>means</i> are very small of course&mdash;he has
not much, and my sister has nothing&mdash;still it seems to me
that they will have enough to live prudently on, and he looks
out for a further appointment. Papa 'will never again let her
name be mentioned in his hearing,' he <i>says</i>, but we must
hope. The dreadful business passed off better on the whole
than poor Arabel expected, and things are going on as
quietly as usual in Wimpole Street now. I feel deeply for
<i>her</i>, who in her pure disinterestedness just pays the price
and suffers the loss. She represents herself, however, to be
relieved at the crisis being passed. I earnestly hope for her
sake that we may be able to get to England this year&mdash;a sight
of us will be some comfort. Henrietta is to live at Taunton
for the present, as he has a military situation there, and they
are preparing for a round of visits among their many friends
who are anxious to have them previous to their settling.
All this, you see, will throw me back with papa, even if I
can be supposed to have gained half a step, and I doubt it.
Oh yes, dearest Miss Mitford. I have indeed again and
again thought of your 'Emily,' stripping the situation of
'the favour and prettiness' associated with that heroine.
Wiedeman might compete, though, in darlingness with the
child, as the poem shows him. Still, I can accept no omen.
My heart sinks when I dwell upon peculiarities difficult to
analyse. I love him very deeply. When I write to him, I
lay myself at his feet. Even if I had gained half a step (and
I doubt it, as I said), see how I must be thrown back by the
indisposition to receive others. But I cannot write of this
subject. Let us change it....</p>

<p>Madame Ossoli sails for America in a few days, with the
hope of returning to Italy, and indeed I cannot believe that
her Roman husband will be easily naturalised among the
Yankees. A very interesting person she is, far better than
her writings&mdash;thoughtful, spiritual in her habitual mode of
mind; not only exalted, but <i>exalt&eacute;e</i> in her opinions, and yet
calm in manner. We shall be sorry to lose her. We have
lost, besides, our friends Mr. and Mrs. Ogilvy, cultivated and
refined people: they occupied the floor above us the last
winter, and at the Baths of Lucca and Florence we have
seen much of them for a year past. She published some
time since a volume of 'Scottish Minstrelsy,' graceful and
flowing, and aspires strenuously towards poetry; a pretty
woman with three pretty children, of quick perceptions and
active intelligence and sensibility. They are upright,
excellent people in various ways, and it is a loss to us that
they should have gone to Naples now. Dearest friend, how
your letter delighted me with its happy account of your
improved strength. Take care of yourself, do, to lose no
ground. The power of walking must refresh your spirits as
well as widen your daily pleasures. I am so glad. Thank
God. We have heard from Mr. Chorley, who seems to
have received very partial gratification in respect to his play
and yet prepares for more plays, more wrestlings in the same
dust. Well, I can't make it out. A man of his sensitiveness
to choose to appeal to the coarsest side of the public&mdash;which,
whatever you dramatists may say, you all certainly do&mdash;is
incomprehensible to me. Then I cannot help thinking
that he might achieve other sorts of successes more easily
and surely. Your criticism is very just. But <i>I</i> like his
'Music and Manners in Germany' better than anything he
has done. I believe I always <i>did</i> like it best, and since
coming to Florence I have heard cultivated Americans
speak of it with enthusiasm, yes, with enthusiasm. 'Pomfret'
they would scarcely believe to be by the same author. I
agree with you, but it is a pity indeed for him to tie himself
to the wheels of the 'Athenaeum,' to <i>approfondir</i> the ruts;
what other end? And, by the way, the 'Athenaeum,' since
Mr. Dilke left it, has grown duller and duller, colder and
colder, flatter and flatter. Mr. Dilke was not brilliant, but
he was a Brutus in criticism; and though it was his
speciality to condemn his most particular friends to the
hangman, the survivors thought there was something grand
about it on the whole, and nobody could hold him in contempt.
Now it is all different. We have not even 'public
virtue' to fasten our admiration to. You will be sure to
think I am vexed at the article on my husband's new poem.<a name="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>
Why, certainly I am vexed! Who would <i>not</i> be vexed with
such misunderstanding and mistaking. Dear Mr. Chorley
writes a letter to appreciate most generously: so you see
how little power he has in the paper to insert an opinion,
or stop an injustice. On the same day came out a burning
panegyric of six columns in the 'Examiner,' a curious
cross-fire. If you read the little book (I wish I could send
you a copy, but Chapman &amp; Hall have not offered us
copies, and you will catch sight of it somewhere), I hope
you will like things in it at least. It seems to me full of
power. Two hundred copies went off in the first fortnight,
which is a good beginning in these days. So I am to confess
to a satisfaction in the American piracies. Well, I
confess, then. Only it is rather a complex smile with which
one hears: 'Sir or Madam, we are selling your book at
half price, as well printed as in England.' 'Those apples
we stole from your garden, we sell at a halfpenny, instead
of a penny as you do; they are much appreciated.' Very
gratifying indeed. It's worth while to rob us, that's plain,
and there's something magnificent in supplying a distant
market with apples out of one's garden. Still the smile is
complex in its character, and the morality&mdash;simple, that's all I
meant to say. A letter from Henrietta and her husband,
glowing with happiness; it makes <i>me</i> happy. She says, 'I
wonder if I shall be as happy as you, Ba.' God grant it.
It was signified to her that she should at once give up her
engagement of five years, or leave the house. She married
directly. I do not understand how it could be otherwise,
indeed. My brothers have been kind and affectionate, I
am glad to say; in her case, poor dearest papa does injustice
chiefly to his own nature, by these severities, hard as they
seem. Write soon and talk of yourself to</p>

<p>I am rejoicing in the People's Edition of your work.
'Viva!' (Robert's best regards.)</p>

<i>To Mrs. Jameson</i><br />
Florence: May 4, [1850],<br />

<p>Dearest Friend,&mdash;This little note will be given to you
by the Mr. Stuart of whom I once told you that he was
holding you up to the admiration of all Florence and the
Baths of Lucca as the best English critic of Shakespeare, in
his lectures on the great poet....</p>

<p>Robert bids me say that he wrote you a constrained
half-dozen lines by Mr. Henry Greenough, who asked for a
letter of introduction to you, while the asker was sitting in
the room, and the form of 'dear Mrs. Jameson' couldn't
well be escaped from. He loves you as well as ever, you
are to understand, through every complication of forms,
and you are to love him, and <i>me</i>, for I come in as a part of
him, if you please. Did you get my thanks for the dear
Petrarch pen (so steeped in double-distilled memories that
it seems scarcely fit to be steeped in ink), and our appreciation
as well as gratitude for the books&mdash;which, indeed,
charm us more and more? Robert has been picking up
pictures at a few pauls each, 'hole and corner' pictures
which the 'dealers' had not found out; and the other day
he covered himself with glory by discovering and seizing on
(in a corn shop a mile from Florence) five pictures among
heaps of trash; and one of the best judges in Florence
(Mr. Kirkup) throws out such names for them as Cimabue,
Ghirlandaio, Giottino, a crucifixion painted on a banner,
Giottesque, if not Giotto, but <i>unique</i>, or nearly so, on
account of the linen material, and a little Virgin by a
Byzantine master. The curious thing is that two angel
pictures, for which he had given a scudo last year, prove to
have been each sawn off the sides of the Ghirlandaio, so
called, representing the 'Eterno Padre' clothed in a
mystical garment and encircled by a rainbow, the various
tints of which, together with the scarlet tips of the flying
seraphs' wings, are darted down into the smaller pictures
and complete the evidence, line for line. It has been a
grand altar-piece, cut to bits. Now come and see for
yourself. We can't say decidedly yet whether it will be
possible or impossible for us to go to England this year,
but in any case you must come to see Gerardine and Italy,
and we shall manage to catch you by the skirts then&mdash;so do
come. Never mind the rumbling of political thunders,
because, even if a storm breaks, you will slip under cover
in these days easily, whether in France or Italy. I can't
make out, for my part, how anybody can be afraid of such
things.</p>

<p>Will you be among the likers or dislikers, I wonder
sometimes, of Robert's new book? The <i>faculty</i>, you will
recognise, in all cases; he can do anything he chooses. I
have complained of the <i>asceticism</i> in the second part, but he
said it was 'one side of the question.' Don't think that he
has taken to the cilix&mdash;indeed he has not&mdash;but it is his way
to <i>see</i> things as passionately as other people <i>feel</i> them....</p>

<p>Chapman &amp; Hall offer us no copies, or you should
have had one, of course. So Wordsworth is gone&mdash;a great
light out of heaven.</p>

<p>May God bless you, my dear friend!</p>

<p>Love your affectionate and grateful, for so many<br />
reasons,<br />
BA.</p>

<p>The death of Wordsworth on April 23 left the Laureateship
vacant, and though there was probably never any likelihood
of Mrs. Browning's being invited to succeed him, it
is worth noticing that her claims were advocated by so
prominent a paper as the 'Athenaeum,' which not only
urged that the appointment would be eminently suitable
under a female sovereign, but even expressed its opinion
that 'there is no living poet of either sex who can prefer a
higher claim than Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.' No
doubt there would have been a certain appropriateness in
the post of Laureate to a Queen being held by a poetess,
but the claims of Tennyson to the primacy of English
poetry were rightly regarded as paramount. The fact that
in Robert Browning there was a poet of equal calibre with
Tennyson, though of so different a type, seems to have
occurred to no one.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: June 15, 1850.<br />

<p>My ever dear Friend,&mdash;How it grieves me that you should
have been so unwell again! From what you say about the
state of the house, I conclude that your health suffers from
that cause precisely; and that when you are warmly and
dryly walled in, you will be less liable to these attacks,
grievous to your friends as to you. Oh, I don't praise
anybody, I assure you, for wishing to entice you to live
near them. We come over the Alps for a sunny climate;
what should we not do for a moral atmosphere like yours?
I dare say you have chosen excellently your new residence,
and I hope you will get over the fuss of it with great
courage, remembering the advantages which it is likely to
secure to you. Tell me as much as you can about it all,
that I may shift the scene in the right grooves, and be able
to imagine you to myself out of Three Mile Cross. You
have the local feeling so eminently that I have long been
resolved on never asking you to migrate. Doves won't
travel with swallows; who should persuade them? This
is no migration&mdash;only a shifting from one branch to
another. With Reading on one side of you still, you will
lose nothing, neither sight nor friend. Oh, do write to me
as soon as you can, and say that the deepening summer
has done you good and given you strength; say it, if
possible. I shall be very anxious for the next letter....
My only objection to Florence is the distance from
London, and the expense of the journey. One's heart is
pulled at through different English ties and can't get the
right rest, and I think we shall move northwards&mdash;try
France a little, after a time. The present year has been
full of petty vexation to us about the difficulty of going to
England, and it becomes more and more doubtful whether
we can attain to the means of doing it. There are four of
us and the child, you see, and precisely this year we are
restricted in means, as far as our present knowledge goes;
but I can't say yet, only I do very much fear. Nobody will
believe our promises, I think, any more, and my poor
Arabel will be in despair, and I shall lose the opportunity
of <i>authenticating</i> Wiedeman; for, as Robert says, all our fine
stories about him will go for nothing, and he will be set
down as a sham child. If not sham, how could human
vanity resist the showing him off bodily? That sounds
reasonable....</p>

<p>Certainly you are disinterested about America, and, of
course, all of us who have hearts and heads must feel the
sympathy of a greater nation to be more precious than a
thick purse. Still, it is not just and dignified, this vantage
ground of American pirates. Liking the ends and
motives, one disapproves the means. Yes, even <i>you</i> do;
and if I were an American I should dissent with still more
emphasis. It should be made a point of honour with the
nation, if there is no point of law against the re publishers.
For my own part, I have every possible reason to thank and
love America; she has been very kind to me, and the visits
we receive here from delightful and cordial persons of that
country have been most gratifying to us. The American
minister at the court of Vienna, with his family, did not
pass through Florence the other day without coming to see
us&mdash;General Watson Webbe-with an air of moral as well as
military command in his brow and eyes. He looked, and
talked too, like one of oar dignities of the Old World. The
go-ahead principle didn't seem the least over-strong in
him, nor likely to disturb his official balance. What is to
happen next in France? Do you trust still your President?
He is in a hard position, and, if he leaves the Pope
where he is, in a dishonored one. As for the change in
the electoral law and the increase of income, I see nothing
in either to make an outcry against. There is great injustice
everywhere and a rankling party-spirit, and to speak
the truth and act it appears still more difficult than usual.
I was sorry, do you know, to hear of dear Mr. Horne's
attempt at Shylock; he is fit for higher things. Did I tell
you how we received and admired his Judas Iscariot?
Yes, surely I did. He says that Louis Blanc is a friend of
his and much with him, speaking with enthusiasm. I
should be more sorry at his being involved with the
Socialists than with Shylock&mdash;still more sorry; for I love
liberty so intensely that I hate Socialism. I hold it to be
the most desecrating and dishonouring to humanity of all
creeds. I would rather (for <i>me</i>) live under the absolutism
of Nicholas of Russia than in a Fourier machine, with my
individuality sucked out of me by a social air-pump. Oh,
if you happen to write again to Mrs. Deane, thank her
much for her kind anxiety; but, indeed, if I had lost my
darling I should not write verses about it.<a name="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> As for the
Laureateship, it won't be given to <i>me</i>, be sure,
though the suggestion has gone the round of the English
newspapers&mdash;'Galignani' and all&mdash;and notwithstanding that most
kind and flattering recommendation of the 'Athenaeum,' for which
I am sure we should be grateful to Mr. Chorley. I think
Leigh Hunt should have the Laureateship. He has condescended
to wish for it, and has 'worn his singing clothes'
longer than most of his contemporaries, deserving the price
of long as well as noble service. Whoever has it will be,
of course, exempted from Court lays; and the distinction of
the title and pension should remain for Spenser's sake, if
not for Wordsworth's. We are very anxious to know about
Tennyson's new work, 'In Memoriam.' Do tell us about
it. You are aware that it was written years ago, and relates
to a son of Mr. Hallam, who was Tennyson's intimate
friend and the betrothed of his sister. I have heard,
through someone who had seen the MS., that it is full of
beauty and pathos.... Dearest, ever dear Miss Mitford,
speak particularly of your health. May God bless you,
prays</p>

E.B.B.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: July 8, 1850.<br />

<p>My dearest Miss Mitford,&mdash;I this moment have your
note; and as a packet of ours is going to England, I snatch
up a pen to do what I can with it in the brief moments
between this and post time. I don't wait till it shall be
possible to write at length, because I have something
immediate to say to you. Your letter is delightful, yet it is
not for <i>that</i> that I rush so upon answering it. Nor even is
it for the excellent news of your consenting, for dear Mr.
Chorley's sake, to give us some more of your 'papers,'<a name="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>
though 'blessed be the hour, and month, and year' when
he set about editing the 'Ladies' Companion' and persuading
you to do such a thing. No, what I want to say is
strictly personal to me. You are the kindest, warmest-hearted,
most affectionate of critics, and precisely as such it
is that you have thrown me into a paroxysm of terror. My
dearest friend, <i>for the love of me</i>&mdash;I don't argue the point
with you&mdash;but I beseech you humbly,&mdash;kissing the hem of
your garment, and by all sacred and tender recollections of
sympathy between you and me, <i>don't</i> breathe a word about
any juvenile performance of mine&mdash;<i>don't</i>, if you have any
love left for me. Dear friend, 'disinter' anybody or anything
you please, but don't disinter <i>me</i>, unless you mean the
ghost of my vexation to vex you ever after. 'Blessed be
she who spares these stones.' All the saints know that I
have enough to answer for since I came to my mature
mind, and that I had difficulty enough in making most of
the 'Seraphim' volume presentable a little in my new
edition, because it was too ostensible before the public to
be caught back; but if the sins of my rawest juvenility are
to be thrust upon me&mdash;and sins are extant of even twelve
or thirteen, or earlier, and I was in print once when I was
ten, I think&mdash;what is to become of me? I shall groan as
loud as Christian did. Dearest Miss Mitford, now forgive
this ingratitude which is gratitude all the time. I love you
and thank you; but, right or wrong, mind what I say, and
let me love and thank you still more. When you see my
new edition you will see that everything worth a straw I
ever wrote is there, and if there were strength in conjuration
I would conjure you to pass an act of oblivion on
the stubble that remains&mdash;if anything does remain, indeed.
Now, more than enough of this. For the rest, I am
delighted. I am even so generous as not to be jealous of
Mr. Chorley for prevailing with you when nobody else
could. I had given it up long ago; I never thought you
would stir a pen again. By what charm did he prevail?
Your series of papers will be delightful, I do not doubt;
though I never could see anything in some of your heroes,
American or Irish. Longfellow is a poet; I don't refer to
<i>him</i>. Still, whatever you say will be worth hearing, and the
<i>guide</i> through 'Pompeii' will be better than many of the
ruins. 'The Pleader's Guide' I never heard of before.
Praed has written some sweet and tender things. Then I
shall like to hear you on Beaumont and Fletcher, and
Andrew Marvell.</p>

<p>I have seen nothing of Tennyson's new poem. Do you
know if the echo-song is the most popular of his verses?
It is only another proof to my mind of the no-worth of
popularity. That song would be eminently sweet for a
common writer, but Tennyson has done better, surely; his
eminences are to be seen above. As for the laurel, in a
sense he is worthier of it than Leigh Hunt; only Tennyson
can wait, that is the single difference.</p>

<p>So anxious I am about your house. Your health seems
to me mainly to depend on your moving, and I do urge
your moving; if not there, elsewhere. May God bless you,
ever dear friend!</p>

<p>I dare say you will think I have given too much importance
to the rococo verses you had the goodness to speak
of; but I have a horror of being disinterred, there's the
truth! Leave the violets to grow over me. Because that
wretched school-exercise of a version of the 'Prometheus'
had been named by two or three people, wasn't I at the
pains of making a new translation before I left England, so
to erase a sort of half-visible and half invisible 'Blot on the
Scutcheon'? After such an expenditure of lemon-juice,
you will not wonder that I should trouble you with all this
talk about nothing....</p>

<p>I am so delighted that you are to lift up your voice
again, and so grateful to Mr. Chorley.</p>

<p>Ah yes, if we go to Paris we shall draw you. Mr.
Chorley shan't have all the triumphs to himself.</p>

<p>Not a word more, says Robert, or the post will be
missed. God bless you! Do take care of yourself, and
<i>don't</i> stay in that damp house. And do make allowances
for love.</p>

<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>How glad I shall be if it is true that Tennyson is
married! I believe in the happiness of marriage, for men
especially.</p>

<p>Through the greater part of the summer of 1850 the
Brownings held fast in Florence, and it was not until September,
when Mrs. Browning was recovering from a rather
sharp attack of illness, that they took a short holiday, going
for a few weeks to Siena, a place which they were again to
visit some years later, during the last two summers of Mrs.
Browning's life. The letter announcing their arrival is the
first in the present collection addressed to Miss Isa
Blagden. Miss Blagden was a resident in Florence for
many years, and was a prominent member of English
society there. Her friendship, not only with Mrs. Browning,
but with her husband, was of a very intimate character, and
was continued after Mrs. Browning's death until the end of
her own life in 1872.</p>

<i>To Miss I. Blagden</i><br />
Siena: September [1850].<br />

<p>Here I am keeping my promise, my dear Miss Blagden.
We arrived quite safely, and I was not too tired to sleep at
night, though tired of course, and the baby was a miracle
of goodness all the way, only inclining once to a <i>rabbia</i>
through not being able to get at the electric telegraph, but in
ecstasies otherwise at everything new. We had to stay at the
inn all night. We heard of a multitude of villas, none of
which could be caught in time for the daylight. On Sunday,
however, just as we were beginning to give it up, in Robert
came with good news, and we were settled in half an hour
afterwards here, a small house of some seven rooms, two
miles from Siena, and situated delightfully in its own grounds
of vineyard and olive ground, not to boast too much of a
pretty little square flower-garden. The grapes hang in
garlands (too tantalising to Wiedeman) about the walls and
before them, and, through and over, we have magnificent
views of a noble sweep of country, undulating hills and
various verdure, and, on one side, the great Maremma
extending to the foot of the Roman mountains. Our villa
is on a hill called 'poggio dei venti,' and the winds give us
a turn accordingly at every window. It is delightfully cool,
and I have not been able to bear my window open at night
since our arrival; also we get good milk and bread and eggs
and wine, and are not much at a loss for anything. Think
of my forgetting to tell you (Robert would not forgive me
for that) how we have a <i>specola</i> or sort of belvedere at the
top of the house, which he delights in, and which I shall
enjoy presently, when I have recovered my taste for climbing
staircases. He carried me up once, but the being carried
down was so much like being carried down the flue of a
chimney, that I waive the whole privilege for the future.
What is better, to my mind, is the expected fact of being
able to get books at Siena&mdash;<i>nearly</i> as well as at Brecker's,
really; though Dumas fils seems to fill up many of the
interstices where you think you have found something.
<i>Three</i> pauls a month, the subscription is; and for seven,
we get a 'Galignani,' or are promised to get it. We pay for
our villa ten scudi the month, so that altogether it is not
ruinous. The air is as fresh as English air, without English
dampness and transition; yes, and we have English lanes
with bowery tops of trees, and brambles and blackberries,
and not a wall anywhere, except the walls of our villa.</p>

<p>For my part, I am recovering strength, I hope and believe.
Certainly I can move about from one room to another,
without reeling much: but I still look so ghastly, as to 'back
recoil,' perfectly knowing 'Why,' from everything in the
shape of a looking glass. Robert has found an armchair for
me at Siena. To say the truth, my time for enjoying this
country life, except the enchanting silence and the look from
the window, has not come yet: I must wait for a little more
strength. Wiedeman's cheeks are beginning to redden
already, and he delights in the pigeons and the pig and the
donkey and a great yellow dog and everything else now;
only he would change all your trees (except the apple trees),
he says, for the Austrian band at any moment. He is rather
a town baby....</p>

<p>Our drawback is, dear Miss Blagden, that we have not
room to take you in. So sorry we both are indeed. Write
and tell me whether you have decided about Vallombrosa.
I hope we shall see much of you still at Florence, if not
here. We could give you everything here except a bed.</p>

<p>Robert's kindest regards with those of</p>
<p>Your ever affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH B. BROWNING.</p>

<p>My love to Miss Agassiz, whenever you see her.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Siena: September 24, 1850.<br />

<p>To think that it is more than two months since I wrote
last to you, my beloved friend, makes the said two months
seem even longer to me than otherwise they would necessarily
be&mdash;a slow, heavy two months in every case, 'with all the
weights of care and death hung at them.' Your letter reached
me when I was confined to my bed, and could scarcely read
it, for all the strength at my heart.... As soon as I could be
moved, and before I could walk from one room to another,
Dr. Harding insisted on the necessity of change of air (for
my part, I seemed to myself more fit to change the world
than the air), and Robert carried me into the railroad like a
baby, and off we came here to Siena. We took a villa a
mile and <i>a</i> half from the town, a villa situated on a windy
hill (called 'poggio al vento'), with magnificent views from
all the windows, and set in the midst of its own vineyard
and olive ground, apple trees and peach trees, not to speak
of a little square flower-garden, for which we pay <i>eleven
shillings one penny farthing the week</i>; and at the end of
these three weeks, our medical comforter's prophecy, to
which I listened so incredulously, is fulfilled, and I am able
to walk a mile, and am really as well as ever in all essential
respects.... Our poor little darling, too (see what disasters!),
was ill four-and-twenty hours from a species of sunstroke,
and frightened us with a heavy hot head and glassy staring
eyes, lying in a half-stupor. Terrible, the silence that fell
suddenly upon the house, without the small pattering feet
and the singing voice. But God spared us; he grew quite
well directly and sang louder than ever. Since we came
here his cheeks have turned into roses....</p>

<p>What still further depressed me during our latter days at
Florence was the dreadful event in America&mdash;the loss of our
poor friend Madame Ossoli,<a name="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> affecting in itself, and also
through association with that past, when the arrowhead of
anguish was broken too deeply into my life ever to be quite
drawn out. Robert wanted to keep the news from me till I
was stronger, but we live too <i>close</i> for him to keep anything
from me, and then I should have known it from the first
letter or visitor, so there was no use trying. The poor
Ossolis spent part of their last evening in Italy with us, he
and she and their child, and we had a note from her off
Gibraltar, speaking of the captain's death from smallpox.
Afterwards it appears that her child caught the disease and
lay for days between life and death; <i>recovered</i>, and then
came the final agony. 'Deep called unto deep,' indeed.
Now she is where there is no more grief and 'no more sea;'
and none of the restless in this world, none of the ship-wrecked
in heart ever seemed to me to want peace more
than she did. We saw much of her last winter; and over a
great gulf of differing opinion we both felt drawn strongly to
her. High and pure aspiration she had&mdash;yes, and a tender
woman's heart&mdash;and we honoured the truth and courage in
her, rare in woman or man. The work she was preparing
upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her
faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her
other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions
her conversation gave you); indeed, she told me it was the
only production to which she had given time and labour.
But, if rescued, the manuscript would be nothing but the raw
material. I believe nothing was finished; nor, if finished,
could the work have been otherwise than deeply coloured
by those blood colours of Socialistic views, which would
have drawn the wolves on her, with a still more howling
enmity, both in England and America. Therefore it was
better for her to go. Only God and a few friends can be
expected to distinguish between the pure personality of a
woman and her professed opinions. She was chiefly known
in America, I believe, by oral lectures and a connection
with the newspaper press, neither of them happy means of
publicity. Was she happy in anything, I wonder? She told
me that she never was. May God have made her happy in
her death!</p>

<p>Such gloom she had in leaving Italy! So full she was
of sad presentiment! Do you know she gave a <i>Bible</i> as a
parting gift from her child to ours, writing in it '<i>In memory
of</i> Angelo Eugene Ossoli'&mdash;a strange, prophetical expression?
That last evening a prophecy was talked of jestingly&mdash;an
old prophecy made to poor Marquis Ossoli, 'that he should
shun the sea, for that it would be fatal to him.' I remember
how she turned to me smiling and said, 'Our ship is called
the &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; and I accept the omen.'</p>

<p>Now I am making you almost dull perhaps, and myself
certainly duller. Rather let me tell you, dearest Miss
Mitford, how delightedly I look forward to reading whatever
you have written or shall write. You write 'as well as
twenty years ago'! Why, I should think so, indeed. Don't
I know what your letters are? Haven't I had faith in you
always? Haven't I, in fact, teased you half to death in
proof of it? I, who was a sort of Brutus, and oughtn't to
have done it, you hinted. Moreover, Robert is a great
admirer of yours, as I must have told you before, and has
the pretension (unjustly though, as I tell <i>him</i>) to place you
still higher among writers than I do, so that we are two
in expectancy here. May Mr. Chorley's periodical live a
thousand years!</p>

<p>As my 'Seagull' won't, but you will find it in my new
edition, and the 'Doves' and everything else worth a straw
of my writing. Here's a fact which you must try to settle
with your theories of simplicity and popularity: <i>None of these
simple poems of mine have been favorites with general readers</i>.
The unintelligible ones are always preferred, I observe, by
extracters, compilers, and ladies and gentlemen who write to
tell me that I'm a muse. The very Corn Law Leaguers in
the North used to leave your 'Seagulls' to fly where they
could, and clap hands over mysteries of iniquity. Dearest
Miss Mitford&mdash;for the rest, don't mistake what I write to you
sometimes&mdash;don't fancy that I undervalue simplicity and
think nothing of legitimate fame&mdash;I only mean to say that
the vogue which begins with the masses generally comes to
nought (B&eacute;ranger is an exceptional case, from the <i>form</i> of
his poems, obviously), while the appreciation beginning with
the few always ends with the masses. Wasn't Wordsworth,
for instance, both simple and unpopular, when he was most
divine? To go to the great from the small, when I complain
of the lamentable weakness of much in my 'Seraphim'
volume, I don't complain of the 'Seagull' and 'Doves' and
the simple verses, but exactly of the more ambitious ones.
I have had to rewrite pages upon pages of that volume.
Oh, such feeble rhymes, and turns of thought&mdash;such a dingy
mistiness! Even Robert couldn't say a word for much of
it. I took great pains with the whole, and made considerable
portions new, only your favourites were not touched&mdash;not
a word touched, I think, in the 'Seagull,' and scarcely
a word in the 'Doves.' You won't complain of me a great
deal, I do hope and trust. Also I put back your 'little
words' into the 'House of Clouds.' The two volumes are
to come out, it appears, at the end of October; not before,
because Mr. Chapman wished to inaugurate them for his
new house in Piccadilly. There are some new poems, and
one rather long ballad written at request of anti-slavery
friends in America.<a name="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> I arranged that it should come next
to the 'Cry of the Children,' to appear impartial as to
national grievances....</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;Balzac&mdash;what a loss! One of the greatest and
(most) original writers of the age gone from us! To hear
this news made Robert and me very melancholy. Indeed,
there seems to be fatality just now with the writers of
France. Souli&eacute;, Bernard, gone too; George Sand translating
Mazzini; Sue in a socialistical state of decadence&mdash;what
he means by writing such trash as the 'P&eacute;ch&eacute;s' I really
can't make out; only Alexandre Dumas keeping his head
up gallantly, and he seems to me to write better than ever.
Here is a new book, just published, by Jules Sandeau, called
'Sacs et Parchemins'! Have you seen it? It miraculously
comes to us from the little Siena library.</p>

<p>We stay in this villa till our month is out, and then we
go for a week into Siena that I may be nearer the churches
and pictures, and see something of the cathedral and
Sodomas. We calculated that it was cheaper to move our
quarters than to have a carriage to and fro, and then Dr.
Harding recommended repeated change of air for me, and
he has proved his ability so much (so kindly too!) that we
are bound to act on his opinions as closely as we can.
Perhaps we may even go to Volterra afterwards, if the
<i>finances</i> will allow of it. If we do, it may be for another
week at farthest, and then we return to Florence. You had
better direct there as usual. And do write and tell me
much of yourself, and set <i>me</i> down in your thoughts as
quite well, and ever yours in warm and grateful affection.</p>

<p>E.B.B.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: November 13, 1850 [postmark].<br />

<p>I <i>meant</i> to cross your second letter, and so, my very
dear friend, you are a second time a prophetess as to my
intentions, while I am still more grateful than I could have
been with the literal fulfilment. Delightful it is to hear
from you&mdash;do always write when you can. And though
this second letter speaks of your having been unwell, still
I shall continue to flatter myself that upon the whole 'the
better part prevails,' and that if the rains don't wash you
away this winter, I may have leave to think of you as
strengthening and to strengthen still. Meanwhile you
certainly, as you say, have roots to your feet. Never was
anyone so pure as you from the drop of gypsey blood which
tingles in my veins and my husband's, and gives us every
now and then a fever for roaming, strong enough to carry
us to Mount Caucasus if it were not for the healthy state of
depletion observable in the purse. I get fond of places, so
does he. We both of us grew rather pathetical on leaving
our Sienese villa, and shrank from parting with the pig.
But setting out on one's travels has a great charm; oh, I
should like to be able to pay our way down the Nile, and
into Greece, and into Germany, and into Spain! Every
now and then we take out the road-books, calculate the
expenses, and groan in the spirit when it's proved for the
hundredth time that we can't do it. One must have a home,
you see, to keep one's books in and one's spring-sofas in;
but the charm of a home is a home <i>to come back to</i>. Do
you understand? No, not you! You have as much
comprehension of the pleasure of 'that sort of thing' as
in the peculiar taste of the three ladies who hung themselves
in a French balloon the other day, operatically <i>nude</i>,
in order, I conjecture, to the ultimate perfection of French
delicacy in morals and manners....</p>

<p>I long to see your papers, and dare say they are charming.
At the same time, just because they are sure to be
charming (and notwithstanding their kindness to me, notwithstanding
that I live in a glass house myself, warmed by
such rare stoves!) I am a little in fear that your generosity
and excess of kindness may run the risk of lowering the
ideal of poetry in England by lifting above the mark the
names of some poetasters. Do you know, you take up
your heart sometimes by mistake, to admire with, when you
ought to use it only to love with? and this is apt to be
dangerous, with your reputation and authority in matters of
literature. See how impertinent I am! But we should all
take care to teach the world that poetry is a divine thing,
should we not? that is, not mere verse-making, though the
verses be pretty in their way. Rather perish every verse <i>I</i>
ever wrote, for one, than help to drag down an inch that
standard of poetry which, for the sake of humanity as well
as literature, should be kept high. As for simplicity and
clearness, did I ever deny that they were excellent qualities?
Never, surely. Only, they will not <i>make</i> poetry; and
absolutely vain they are, and indeed all other qualities,
without the essential thing, the genius, the inspiration, the
insight&mdash;let us call it what we please&mdash;without which
the most accomplished verse-writers had far better write
prose, for their own sakes as for the world's&mdash;don't you
think so? Which I say, because I sighed aloud over many
names in your list, and now have taken pertly to write out
the sigh at length. Too charmingly you are sure to have
written&mdash;and see the danger! But Miss Fanshawe is well
worth your writing of (let me say that I am sensible warmly of
that) as one of the most witty of our wits in verse, men or
women. I have only seen manuscript copies of some of her
verses, and that years ago, but they struck me very much;
and really I do not remember another female wit worthy to
sit beside her, even in French literature. Motherwell is a
true poet. But oh, I don't believe in your John Clares,
Thomas Davises, Whittiers, Hallocks&mdash;and still less in other
names which it would be invidious to name again. How
pert I am! But you give me leave to be pert, and you
know the meaning of it all, after all. Your editor quarrelled
a little with me once, and I with him, about the 'poetesses
of the united empire,' in whom I couldn't or wouldn't find
a poet, though there are extant two volumes of them, and
Lady Winchilsea at the head. I hold that the writer of
the ballad of 'Robin Gray' was our first poetess rightly so
called, before Joanna Baillie.</p>

<p>Mr. Lever is in Florence, I believe, now, and was at the
Baths of Lucca in the summer. We never see him; it is
curious. He made his way to us with the sunniest of
faces and cordialest of manners at Lucca; and I, who am
much taken by manner, was quite pleased with him, and
wondered how it was that I didn't like his books. Well,
he only wanted to see that we had the right number of eyes
and no odd fingers. Robert, in return for his visit, called
on him three times, I think, and I left my card on Mrs.
Lever. But he never came again&mdash;he had seen enough of
us, he could put down in his private diary that we had
neither claw nor tail; and there an end, properly enough.
In fact, he lives a different life from ours: he in the ballroom
and we in the cave, nothing could be more different;
and perhaps there are not many subjects of common
interest between us. I have seen extracts in the 'Examiner'
from Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' which seemed to me
exquisitely beautiful and pathetical. Oh, there's a poet,
talking of poets. Have you read Wordsworth's last work&mdash;the
legacy? With regard to the elder Miss Jewsbury, do
you know, I take Mr. Chorley's part against you, because,
although I know her only by her writings, the writings seem
to me to imply a certain vigour and originality of mind, by
no means ordinary. For instance, the fragments of her
letters in his 'Memorials of Mrs. Hemans' are much
superior to any other letters almost in the volume&mdash;certainly
to Mrs. Hemans's own. Isn't this so? And so you talk,
you in England, of Prince Albert's 'folly,' do you really?
Well, among the odd things we lean to in Italy is to
an actual belief in the greatness and importance of the
future exhibition. We have actually imagined it to be a
noble idea, and you take me by surprise in speaking of the
general distaste to it in England. Is it really possible?
For the agriculturists, I am less surprised at coldness on
their part; but do you fancy that the manufacturers and free-traders
are cold too? Is Mr. Chorley against it equally?
Yes, I am glad to hear of Mrs. Butler's success&mdash;or Fanny
Kemble's, ought I to say? Our little Wiedeman, who
can't speak a word yet, waxes hotter in his ecclesiastical
and musical passion. Think of that baby (just cutting his
eyeteeth) screaming in the streets till he is taken into the
churches, kneeling on his knees to the first sound of music,
and folding his hands and turning up his eyes in a sort of
ecstatical state. One scarcely knows how to deal with the
sort of thing: it is too soon for religious controversy. He
crosses himself, I assure you. Robert says it is as well to
have the eyeteeth and the Puseyistical crisis over together.
The child is a very curious imaginative child, but too excitable
for his age, that's all I complain of ... God bless you, my
much loved friend. Write to</p>

<p>What books by Souli&eacute; have appeared since his death?
Do you remember? I have just got 'Les Enfants de

of legitimacy, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Sue is in decided decadence,
for the rest, since he has taken to illustrating Socialism!</p>

<i>To Miss I. Blagden</i><br />
[Florence:] Sunday morning [about 1850].<br />

<p>My dear Miss Blagden,&mdash;In spite of all your <i>drawing</i>
kindness, we find it impossible to go to you on Monday.
We are expecting friends from Rome who will remain only
a few days, perhaps, in Florence. Now it seems to me that
you very often pass our door. Do you not too often leave
the trace of your goodness with me? And would it not be
better of you still, if you would at once make use of us and
give us pleasure by pausing here, you and Miss Agassiz, to
rest and refresh yourselves with tea, coffee, or whatever else
you may choose? We shall be delighted to see you always,
and don't fancy that I say so out of form or 'tinkling
cymbalism.'</p>

<p>Thank you for your intention about the 'Leader.' Robert
and I shall like much to see anything of John Mill's on the
subject of Socialism or any other. By the 'British Review,'
do you mean the <i>North British</i>? I read a clever article in
that review some months ago on the German Socialists, ably
embracing in its analysis the fraternity in France, and attributed,
I have since heard, to Dr. Hanna, the son-in-law and
biographer of Chalmers. Christian Socialists are by no means
a new sect, the Moravians representing the theory with as
little offence and absurdity as may be. What is it, after all,
but an out-of-door extension of the monastic system? The
religious principle, more or less apprehended, may bind men
together so, absorbing their individualities, and presenting
an aim <i>beyond the world</i>; but upon merely human and
earthly principles no such system can stand, I feel persuaded,
and I thank God for it. If Fourierism could be realised
(which it surely cannot) out of a dream, the destinies of
our race would shrivel up under the unnatural heat, and
human nature would, in my mind, be desecrated and
dishonored&mdash;because I do not believe in purification without
suffering, in progress without struggle, in virtue without
temptation. Least of all do I consider happiness the end
of man's life. We look to higher things, have nobler ambitions.</p>

<p>Also, in every advancement of the world hitherto, the
individual has led the masses. Thus, to elicit individuality
has been the object of the best political institutions and
governments. Now, in these new theories, the individual
is ground down into the multitude, and society must be
'moving all together if it moves at all'&mdash;restricting the very
possibility of progress by the use of the lights of genius.
Genius is <i>always individual</i>.</p>

<p>Here's a scribble upon grave matters! I ought to
be acknowledging instead your scrupulous honesty, as
illustrated by five-franc pieces and Tuscan florins. Make
us as useful as you can do, for the future; and please us by
coming often. I am afraid your German Baroness could
not make an arrangement with you, as you do not mention
her. Give our best regards to Miss Agassiz, and accept
them yourself, dear Miss Blagden, from</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.</p>
<br /><br />


<i>To Mr. Westwood</i><br />
Florence: Thursday, December 12, 1850.<br />

<p>My dear Mr. Westwood,&mdash;Your book has not reached
us yet, and so if I waited for that, to write, I might wait
longer still. But I don't wait for that, because you bade
me not to do so, and besides we have only this moment
finished reading 'In Memoriam,' and it was a sort of
miracle with us that we got it so soon....</p>

<p><i>December</i> 13.&mdash;The above sentences were written yesterday,
and hardly had they been written when your third
letter came with its enclosure. How very kind you are to
me, and how am I to thank you enough! If you had not
sent me the 'Athenaeum' article I never should have seen
it probably, for my husband only saw it in the reading
room, where women don't penetrate (because in Italy we
can't read, you see), and where the periodicals are kept so
strictly, like Hesperian apples, by the dragons of the place,
that none can be stolen away even for half an hour. So
he could only wish me to catch sight of that article&mdash;and
you are good enough to send it and oblige us both
exceedingly. For which kindness thank you, thank you!
The favor shown to me in it is extreme, and I am as
grateful as I ought to be. Shall I ask the 'Note and
Query' magazine why the 'Athenaeum' does show me so
much favor, while, as in a late instance, so little justice is
shown to my husband? It's a problem, like another. As
for poetry, I hope to do better things in it yet, though I <i>have</i>
a child to 'stand in my sunshine,' as you suppose he must;
but he only makes the sunbeams brighter with his glistening
curls, little darling&mdash;and who can complain of that? You
can't think what a good, sweet, curious, imagining child he
is. Half the day I do nothing but admire him&mdash;there's the
truth. He doesn't talk yet much, but he gesticulates with
extraordinary force of symbol, and makes surprising revelations
to us every half-hour or so. Meanwhile Flush loses
nothing, I assure you. On the contrary, he is hugged and
kissed (rather too hard sometimes), and never is permitted
to be found fault with by anybody under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.
If Flush is scolded, Baby cries as matter of course, and he
would do admirably for a 'whipping-boy' if that excellent
institution were to be revived by Young England and the
Tractarians for the benefit of our deteriorated generations.
I was ill towards the end of last summer, and we had to go
to Siena for the sake of getting strength again, and there we
lived in a villa among a sea of little hills, and wrapt up in
vineyards and olive yards, enjoying everything. Much the
worst of Italy is, the drawback about books. Somebody
said the other day that we 'sate here like posterity'&mdash;reading
books with the gloss off them. But our case in reality is
far more dreary, seeing that Prince Posterity will have
glossy books of his own. How exquisite 'In Memoriam'
is, how earnest and true; after all, the gloss never can
wear off books like that.</p>

<p>And as to your book, it will come, it will come, and
meantime I may assure you that posterity is very impatient
for it. The Italian poem will be read with the interest
which is natural. You know it's a more than doubtful
point whether Shakespeare ever saw Italy out of a vision,
yet he and a crowd of inferior writers have written about
Venice and vineyards as if born to the manner of them.
We hear of Carlyle travelling in France and Germany&mdash;but
I must leave room for the words you ask for from a certain
hand below.</p>

<p>Ever dear Mr. Westwood's obliged and faithful</p>

<p>E.B.B.</p>

<p>And the 'certain hand' will write its best (and far
better than any poor 'Pippa Passes') in recording a feeling
which does not pass at all, that of gratitude for all such
generous sympathy as dear Mr. Westwood's for E.B.B.
and (in his proper degree) R. BROWNING.</p>

<i>To Miss Mitford</i><br />
Florence: December 13, 1850.<br />

<p><i>Did</i> I write a scolding letter, dearest Miss Mitford? So
much the better, when people deserve to be scolded. The
worst is, however, that it sometimes does them no sort of
good, and that they will sit on among the ruins of Carthage,
let ever so many messages come from Italy. My only
hope now is, that you will have a mild winter in England,
as we seem likely to have it here; and that in the spring,
by the help of some divine interposition of friends supernaturally
endowed (after the manner of Mr. Chorley), you
may be made to go away into a house with fast walls and
chimneys. Certainly, if you could be made to <i>write</i>,
anything else is possible. That's my comfort. And the
other's my hope, as I said; and so between hope and consolation
I needn't scold any more. Let me tell you what I
have heard of Mrs. Gaskell, for fear I should forget it later.
She is connected by marriage with Mrs. A.T. Thompson,
and from a friend of Mrs. Thompson's it came to me, and
really seems to exonerate Chapman &amp; Hall from the
charge advanced against them. 'Mary Barton' was shown
in manuscript to Mrs. Thompson, and failed to please her;
and, in deference to her judgment, certain alterations were
made. Subsequently it was offered to all or nearly all the
publishers in London and rejected. Chapman &amp; Hall
accepted and gave a hundred pounds, as you heard, for the
copyright of the work; and though the success did not,
perhaps (that is quite possible), induce any liberality with
regard to copies, they gave <i>another hundred pounds</i> upon
printing the second edition, and it was not in the bond to
do so. I am told that the liberality of the proceeding was
appreciated by the author and her friends accordingly&mdash;and
there's the end of my story. Two hundred pounds is a good
price&mdash;isn't it?&mdash;for a novel, as times go. Miss Lynn had
only a hundred and fifty for her Egyptian novel, or perhaps
for the Greek one. Taking the long run of poetry (if it runs
at all), I am half given to think that it pays better than the
novel does, in spite of everything. Not that we speak out
of golden experience; alas, no! We have had not a sou
from our books for a year past, the booksellers being bound
of course to cover their own expenses first. Then this
Christmas account has not yet reached us. But the former
editions paid us regularly so much a year, and so will the
present ones, I hope. Only I was not thinking of <i>them</i>, in
preferring what may strike you as an extravagant paradox,
but of Tennyson's returns from Moxon last year, which I
understand amounted to five hundred pounds. To be sure,
'In Memoriam' was a new success, which should not
prevent our considering the fact of a regular income proceeding
from the previous books. A novel flashes up for a
season and does not often outlast it. For 'Mary Barton' I
am a little, little disappointed, do you know. I have just
done reading it. There is power and truth&mdash;she can shake
and she can pierce&mdash;but I wish half the book away, it is so
tedious every now and then; and besides I want more
beauty, more air from the universal world&mdash;these classbooks
must always be defective as works of art. How
could I help being disappointed a little when Mrs. Jameson
told me that 'since the &quot;Bride of Lammermoor,&quot; nothing
had appeared equal to &quot;Mary Barton&quot;?' Then the style
of the book is slovenly, and given to a kind of phraseology
which would be vulgar even as colloquial English. Oh, it
is a powerful book in many ways. You are not to set me
down as hypercritical. Probably the author will, write
herself clear of many of her faults: she has strength enough.
As to 'In Memoriam,' I have seen it, I have read it&mdash;dear
Mr. Kenyon had the goodness to send it to me by an
American traveller&mdash;and now I really do disagree with you,
for the book has gone to my heart and soul; I think it full
of deep pathos and beauty. All I wish away is the
marriage hymn at the end, and <i>that</i> for every reason I wish
away&mdash;it's a discord in the music. The monotony is a
part of the position&mdash;(the sea is monotonous, and so is lasting
grief.) Your complaint is against fate and humanity rather
than against the poet Tennyson. Who that has suffered
has not felt wave after wave break dully against one rock,
till brain and heart, with all their radiances, seemed lost in
a single shadow? So the effect of the book is artistic, I
think, and indeed I do not wonder at the opinion which
has reached us from various quarters that Tennyson stands
higher through having written it. You see, what he appeared
to want, according to the view of many, was an earnest
personality and direct purpose. In this last book, though
of course there is not room in it for that exercise of creative
faculty which elsewhere established his fame, he appeals
heart to heart, directly as from his own to the universal
heart, and we all feel him nearer to us&mdash;<i>I</i> do&mdash;and so do
others. Have you read a poem called 'the Roman' which
was praised highly in the 'Athenaeum,' but did not seem
to Robert to justify the praise in the passages extracted?
written by somebody with certainly a <i>nom de guerre</i>&mdash;Sidney
Yendys. Observe, <i>Yendys</i> is <i>Sidney</i> reversed. Have you
heard anything about it, or seen? The 'Athenaeum' has
been gracious to me beyond gratitude almost; nothing
could by possibility be kinder. A friend of mine sent me the
article from Brussels&mdash;a Mr. Westwood, who writes poems
himself; yes, and poetical poems too, written with an odorous,
fresh sense of poetry about them. He has not original
power, more's the pity: but he has stayed near the rose in
the 'sweet breath and buddings of the spring,' and although
that won't make anyone live beyond spring-weather, it is the
expression of a sensitive and aspirant nature; and the man is
interesting and amiable&mdash;an old correspondent of mine, and
kind to me always. From the little I know of Mr. Bennett,
I should say that Mr. Westwood stood much higher in the
matter of gifts, though I fear that neither of them will make
way in that particular department of literature selected by
them for action. Oh, my dearest friend, you may talk
about coteries, but the English society at Florence (from
what I hear of the hum of it at a distance) is worse than
any coterie-society in the world. A coterie, if I understand
the thing, is informed by a unity of sentiment, or faith, or
prejudice; but this society here is not informed at all.
People come together to gamble or dance, and if there's an
end, why so much the better; but there's <i>not</i> an end in
most cases, by any manner of means, and against every sort
of innocence. Mind, I imply nothing about Mr. Lever,
who lives irreproachably with his wife and family, rides out
with his children in a troop of horses to the Cascine, and
yet is as social a person as his joyous temperament leads
him to be. But we live in a cave, and peradventure he is
afraid of the damp of us&mdash;who knows? We know very few
residents in Florence, and these, with chance visitors, chiefly
Americans, are all that keep us from solitude; every now
and then in the evening somebody drops in to tea. Would,
indeed, you were near! but should I be satisfied with you
'once a week,' do you fancy. Ah, you would soon love
Robert. You couldn't help it, I am sure. I should be
soon turned down to an underplace, and, under the
circumstances, would not struggle. Do you remember once
telling me that 'all men are tyrants'?&mdash;as sweeping an
opinion as the Apostle's, that 'all men are liars.' Well, if
you knew Robert you would make an exception certainly.
Talking of the artistical English here, somebody told me
the other day of a young Cambridge or Oxford man who
deducted from his researches in Rome and Florence that
'Michael Angelo was a wag.' Another, after walking
through the Florentine galleries, exclaimed to a friend of
mine, 'I have seen nothing here equal to those magnificent
pictures in Paris by Paul de Kock.' My friend humbly
suggested that he might mean Paul de la Roche. But see
what English you send us for the most part. We have had
one very interesting visitor lately, the grandson of Goethe.
He did us the honour, he said, of spending two days in
Florence on our account, he especially wishing to see
Robert on account of some sympathy of view about 'Paracelsus.'
There can scarcely be a more interesting young
man&mdash;quite young he seems, and full of aspiration of the
purest kind towards the good and true and beautiful, and
not towards the poor laurel crowns attainable from any
possible public. I don't know when I have been so
charmed by a visitor, and indeed Robert and I paid him
the highest compliment we could, by wishing, one to
another, that our little Wiedeman might be like him some
day. I quite agree with you about the church of your
Henry. It surprises me that a child of seven years should
find pleasure even once a day in the long English service&mdash;too
long, according to my doxy, for matured years. As to
fanaticism, it depends on a defect of intellect rather than on
an excess of the adoring faculty. The latter cannot, I
think, be too fully developed. How I shall like you to
see our Wiedeman! He is a radiant little creature, really,
yet he won't talk; he does nothing but gesticulate, only
making his will and pleasure wonderfully clear and
supreme, I assure you. He's a tyrant, ready made for your
theory. If your book is 'better than I expect,' what will it
be? God bless you! Be well, and love me, and write to
me, for I am your ever affectionate</p>

<p>BA.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Mrs. Martin</i><br />
Florence: January 30, 1851.<br />

<p>Here I am at last, dearest friend. But you forget how
you told me, when you wrote your 'long letter,' that you
were going away into chaos somewhere, and that your
address couldn't be known yet. It was this which made
me delay the answer to that welcome letter&mdash;and to begin
to 'put off' is fatal, as perhaps you know. Now forgive me,
and I will behave better in future, indeed....</p>

<p>I am quite well, and looking well, they say; but the
frightful illness of the autumn left me paler and thinner
long after the perfect recovery. The physician told Robert
afterwards that few women would have recovered at all;
and when I left Siena I was as able to walk, and as well in
every respect as ever, notwithstanding everything&mdash;think,
for instance, of my walking to St. Miniato, here in
Florence! You remember, perhaps, what that pull is. I
dare say you heard from Henrietta how we enjoyed our
rustication at Siena. It is pleasant even to look back on
it. We were obliged to look narrowly at the economies,
more narrowly than usual; but the cheapness of the place
suited the occasion, and the little villa, like a mere tent
among the vines, charmed us, though the doors didn't shut,
and though (on account of the smallness) Robert and I had
to whisper all our talk whenever Wiedeman was asleep. Oh,
I wish you were in Italy. I wish you had come here this
winter which has been so mild, and which, with ordinary
prudence, would certainly have suited dear Mr. Martin....
I tried to dissuade the Peytons from making the
experiment, through the fear of its not answering.... We
can't get them into society, you see, because we are out of
it, having struggled to keep out of it with hands and feet,
and partially having succeeded, knowing scarcely anybody
except bringers of letters of introduction, and those chiefly
Americans and not residents in Florence. The other day,
however, Mrs. Trollope and her daughter-in-law called on
us, and it is settled that we are to know them; though
Robert had made a sort of vow never to sit in the same
room with the author of certain books directed against
liberal institutions and Victor Hugo's poetry. I had a
longer battle to fight, on the matter of this vow, than any
since my marriage, and had some scruples at last of taking
advantage of the pure goodness which induced him to yield
to my wishes; but I <i>did</i>, because I hate to seem ungracious
and unkind to people; and human beings, besides, are
better than their books, than their principles, and even than
their everyday actions, sometimes. I am always crying out:
'Blessed be the inconsistency of men.' Then I thought it
probable that, the first shock of the cold water being over,
he would like the proposed new acquaintances very much&mdash;and
so it turns out. She was very agreeable, and kind, and
good-natured, and talked much about <i>you</i>, which was a
charm of itself; and we mean to be quite friends, and to
lend each other books, and to forget one another's offences,
in print or otherwise. Also, she admits us on her private
days; for she has public days (dreadful to relate!), and is
in the full flood and flow of Florentine society. Do write
to me, will you? or else I shall set you down as vexed with
me. The state of politics here is dismal. Newspapers put
down; Protestant places of worship shut up. It is so bad
that it must soon be better. What are you both thinking of
the 'Papal aggression'?<a name="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> 'Are you frightened? Are you
frenzied? For my part I can't get up much steam about
it. The 'Great Insult' was simply a great mistake, the
consequence (natural enough) of the Tractarian idiocies as
enacted in Italy.</p>

<p>God bless both of you, dearest and always remembered
friends! Robert's best regards, he says.</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br />
BA.</p>

<p>Tell me your thoughts about France. I am so anxious
about the crisis there.<a name="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> We have had a very interesting visit lately from the grandson of Goethe.</p>
<br /><br />

<i>To Miss Browning</i><br />
Florence: April 23, 1851 [postmark].<br />

<p>My dearest Sarianna,&mdash;I do hope that Robert takes his
share of the blame in using and abusing you as we have
done. It was altogether too bad&mdash;shameful&mdash;to send that
last MS. for you to copy out; and I did, indeed, make a
little outcry about it, only he insisted on having it so. Was
it very wrong, I wonder? Your kindness and affectionateness
I never doubt of; but if you are not quite strong just
now, you might be teased, in spite of your heart, by all that
copying work&mdash;not pleasant at any time. Well, believe that
I thank you, at least gratefully, for what you have done.
So quickly too! The advertisement at the end of the week
proves how you must have worked for me. Thank you,
dear Sarianna.</p>

<p>Robert will have told you our schemes, and how we are
going to work, and are to love you <i>near</i> for the future, I
hope. You, who are wise, will approve of us, I think, for
keeping on our Florentine apartment, so as to run no more
risk than is necessary in making the Paris experiment. We
shall let the old dear rooms, and make money by them, and
keep them to fall back upon, in case we fail at Paris. 'But
we'll not fail.' Well, I hope not, though I am very brittle
still and susceptible to climate. Dearest Sarianna, it will do
you infinite good to come over to us every now and then&mdash;you
want change, absolute change of scene and air and
climate, I am confident; and you never will be right till
you have had it. We talk, Robert and I, of carrying you
back with us to Rome next year as an English trophy.
Meanwhile you will see Wiedeman, you and dear Mr.
Browning. Don't expect to see a baby of Anak, that's all.
Robert is always measuring him on the door, and reporting
such wonderful growth (some inch a week, I think), that if
you receive his reports you will cry out on beholding the
child. At least, you'll say: 'How little he must have been
to be no larger now.' You'll fancy he must have begun
from a mustard-seed! The fact is, he is small, only full of
life and joy to the brim. I am not afraid of your not
loving him, nor of his not loving you. He has a loving
little heart, I assure you. If anyone pricks a finger with
a needle he begins to cry&mdash;he can't bear to see the least
living thing hurt. And when he loves, it is well. Robert
says I must finish, so here ends dearest Sarianna's</p>

wealthy West Indian landowner, but came to England while quite a
boy, and was a conspicuous figure in literary society during the second
quarter of the century. He published some volumes of minor verse,
but is best known for his friendships with many literary men and
women, and for his boundless generosity and kindliness to all with
whom he was brought into contact. Crabb Robinson described him as
a man 'whose life is spent in making people happy.' He was a distant
cousin of Miss Barrett, and a friend of Robert Browning, who dedicated
to him his volume of 'Dramatic Romances,' besides writing and sending
to him 'Andrea del Sarto' as a substitute for a print of the painter's
portrait which he had been unable to find. The best account of
Kenyon is to be found in Mrs. Crosse's 'John Kenyon and his Friends'
(in <i>Red-Letter Days of My Life</i>, vol. i.).</p></div>

pleasure to Miss Barrett, and which she treasured among her papers for
the rest of her life. Two slips of the pen have been corrected between
brackets.
</p><p>
'Rydal Mount: Oct. 26, '42.
</p><p>
'Dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;Through our common friend Mr. Haydon I
have received a sonnet which his portrait of me suggested. I should
have thanked you sooner for that effusion of a feeling towards myself,
with which I am much gratified, but I have been absent from home
and much occupied.
</p><p>
'The conception of your sonnet is in full accordance with the
painter's intended work, and the expression vigorous; yet the word
&quot;ebb,&quot; though I do not myself object to it, nor wish to have it altered,
will I fear prove obscure to nine readers out of ten.
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A vision free</span><br />
And noble, Haydon, hath thine art released.&quot;<br />
</p><p>
Owing to the want of inflections in our language the construction here is
obscure. Would it not be a little [better] thus? I was going to write a
small change in the order of the words, but I find it would not remove
the objection. The verse, as I take it, would be somewhat clearer thus,
if you would tolerate the redundant syllable:
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;By a vision free</span><br />
And noble, Haydon, is thine art released.&quot;<br />
</p><p>
I had the gratification of receiving, a good while ago, two copies of a
volume of your writing, which I have read with much pleasure, and
beg that the thanks which I charged a friend to offer may be repeated
[to] you.
</p><p>
'It grieved me much to hear from Mr. Kenyon that your health is
so much deranged. But for that cause I should have presumed to call
upon you when I was in London last spring.
</p><p>
'With every good wish, I remain, dear Miss Barrett, your much
obliged
</p><p>
'WM. WORDSWORTH.'
</p><p>
(Postmark: Ambleside, Oct. 28, 1842.)

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
